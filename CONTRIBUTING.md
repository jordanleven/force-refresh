# Contributing to Force Refresh

To streamline development, a sandbox WordPress environment is available via Docker. This will map the Force Refresh plugin directory to the plugins directory on the WordPress image and pre-populate the database with sample data.

To get started, follow the steps below:

## Starting the development environment

1. Download Docker for your Mac or PC.
2. Start the environment by running `docker-compose up` in the project directory.
3. Visit [localhost](http://localhost) on your browser of choice.

## Admin

To log into the WordPress admin, visit [localhost/wp-admin](http://localhost/wp-admin) and log in with the following development credentials:

**Username**: `force-refresh-dev`

**Password**: `dross_dread_motto1polopony9treacle*SERAGLIO.unctuous8sighted`

[Docker]: www.docker.com
