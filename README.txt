Force Refresh is a simple plugin that allows you to force a page refresh for users currently visiting your site.


== Description ==

Force Refresh is a simple plugin that allows you to force a page refresh for users currently visiting your site.

**Features**

- Support for both parent and child themes
- Allows an admin to simply click a button to request browsers to refresh their page. This is done within two minutes after making the request.

**Feature Requests and Bug Reports**

Please report any feature requests you have or bugs you encounter [under the Support tab](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/force-refresh). This is a new plugin and I'm hoping to add more user-requested features to make this useful to developers.

== Installation ==

Upload the Force Refresh plugin to your site, and then simply activate it. To force a refresh, just navigate to "Tools", click on "Force Refresh" and click the button that says, "Refresh Site."
