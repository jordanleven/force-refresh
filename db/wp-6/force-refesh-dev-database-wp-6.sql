I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> My friends, another WordCamp Europe is in the books. We had the second-highest number of tickets sold in the history of our event series, with the first being WordCamp Europe in Berlin. But even with that number of tickets sold, that number of people gathering together to talk about WordPress and related things, there were still a lot of people who didn&#8217;t get to join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> For some, that came with experiencing FOMO, but some of you embraced the JOMO of it all. Either way, at this point, there are a good collection of wrap-ups and round-ups going around, so I&#8217;m here to tell you a bit about what was buzzing in the hallway track.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, everyone was so excited to see old friends and make new ones. Everywhere I turned, I saw WordPressers in clusters catching up, most included new to the crew faces. So we know that we were using the Pac-Man rule that we love so much. But even while they were catching up on the last two, three, four years, they were also talking to each other about how to get more folks to things like this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we all generally agree that your first time meeting other WordPressers can be a truly pivotal moment in your WordPress journey, it was a delight to hear so much brainstorming focused on that. From mentorship to community introduction and the future of our events, the question of how to keep our ecosystem healthy and thriving was a big topic. Does any one of us have all the answers to this? No, but fortunately, we&#8217;ve got a global set of thinkers working on this global question. So, together, I&#8217;m sure we can come up with some good guesses to try out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Secondly, I saw a ton of talks and discussions about career development, not only about how to learn more but also how to be a champion for open source in your company, how to advocate for contribution as a best business practice. And what other communities can teach us about how they commit to their user&#8217;s continuing education, for lack of a friendlier term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And boy, do I love a good conversation about how to make working in open source easier, make it more meaningful, and more impactful. I&#8217;m in favor of anything that helps to dignify our profession. The front-facing, easy-to-use experience of WordPress, in particular, has been misunderstood to mean that we are a simple piece of software for simple tasks. And that is the way with our mission really. If we succeed at democratizing publishing or learning or commerce for that matter, we are taking the arcane and making it mundane. But simple to use doesn&#8217;t mean simple to create. And I want all of our future employers and clients to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:24] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing that I saw lighting up the hallway track was the idea of bringing life and excitement back to the web. WordPress has been fighting against closed systems for a long time, but as Matt alluded to in his keynote, merely having an open web is still not quite as fun as having an active and dynamic one. And we saw that both in general desire to bring fun back to being online, but also in the fresh variety of demos and workshops that we saw in the fun that was brought to the event. There were new and shocking implementations of Playground, I must say. Which, as far as I can tell, will basically be able to run everything one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But at WordCamp Europe, it ran; it powered our second massive hybrid translation event, where we translated something like 50,000 strings. We also had an amazing speed-building duel with an accepted future challenge between Jessica Lyschik and Matt Mullenweg. And not for nothing; the way we designed; the way the event area was put together included ways to stop and just have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a little grassy area with yard games and smaller pods of chairs for those quick hallway catch-ups that you just don&#8217;t get anywhere else. And for me, it was simply lovely to see everyone embracing the fun that was there, but also hearing about how much they wanted to help the web embrace the fun that could be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:48] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:55] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Thanks for listening to my hallway track recap. Hopefully, it caused JOMO, not FOMO. And now, let&#8217;s turn our attention to the small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> First thing on my list is WordPress 6.6 update. So we are reaching the release candidate phase tomorrow. WordPress 6.6 RC1 will be released, so download and join the community helping us to get this release out the door. It is scheduled for July 16th. If you have plugins or themes or any sort of business that uses WordPress, now is the time to get in and test it on a test site. I don&#8217;t recommend putting it in production at any point, but come and test it. Help us break it so that we can make sure that it doesn&#8217;t break for other people, for the, you know, 43% of the web that uses it when we get it out the door on the 16th.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on the list is that we have a WordPress Project Contributor Handbook V2 out there. It aims to be the quintessential resource for everyone in our community. And it will provide a bird&#8217;s eye view of where to find key information and different aspects of our community. How it all kind of connects together. And, just like a release, we really need some feedback from you. There is the repo on GitHub where you can go and kind of make inline comments, join the discussion about it. It can be a go-to resource if we look at it together and make sure that it has as much information as clearly stated as you wished you had when you were learning your way around WordPress for the first time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing on the list is actually another handbook. So, the Sustainability Team has put together a handbook specifically for events. It&#8217;s their first version, and over the past few months, members of that team have been sharing their ideas and experiences on how WordPress community events can be held more sustainably. All this input created a first draft, which eventually became this first version. And so we&#8217;ll put a link in the show notes, wander over there, take a look at it, see what some best practices for sustainable events are in the WordPress ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:02] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing on my list is about WordCamp US. I realize this is a podcast about WordCamp Europe right now. And so it&#8217;s odd to think that I&#8217;m moving right along into WordCamp US. However, there is a deadline coming up. July 1st is the last day to sign up to be a volunteer at this event. It&#8217;s taking place this year in Portland, Oregon, on the west side of the US. And it should be a really fun time. It&#8217;s middle of September. Come on out there. Learn about WordPress. Learn about contribution. Maybe get some voodoo donuts. You know, the important things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser. Or, if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at WPBriefing@WordPress.org. I am your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:06] (Music outro)&nbsp;</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"17409\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"WordPress 6.6 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/06/wordpress-6-6-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Jun 2024 16:37:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:7:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.6\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=17392\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:342:\"WordPress 6.6 Beta 3 is here!

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> A pivotal moment in my WordPress journey was when someone invited me to a WordCamp. I was sort of aware of WordPress, but certainly not aware of the community or the ways of open source. And when I look back, there were a few things I wish I had known going in. I am, of course, an unapologetic extrovert and therefore unstoppable at events, but if you are headed to your first WordCamp and are feeling a little nervous or confused, then pop in some earbuds because the next 10 minutes are for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We&#8217;re going to first take a look at some basic tactical things about WordCamps, and then I&#8217;m going to tell you a few, like, human things about being a human going to events. If you&#8217;re a dog going to these events, I think that your prep is different, but also that is not my area of expertise. So the first thing, some tactical stuff about going to WordCamps. All of this happens before you even get in the front door. And so this is stuff that you can do in the comfort of your own home, on your own time, using your own computer. If you&#8217;ve got questions, you&#8217;ve got a search engine nearby to take some quick searches. Make sure you know what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first things first, the shape of a WordCamp. All WordCamps have at least one day of talks, one social event, and sponsors to connect to. Some also have extra events that you need to sign up for, like Contributor Days, workshops, things like that. But we&#8217;ll start with the main event, right? We&#8217;re going to start with the day of talks and things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So when we&#8217;re looking at the main event of a WordCamp, what you should do is you should head to the WordCamp&#8217;s website and check out the schedule. I suggest that you plan for two, maybe three things that you might want to learn and look around at the schedule to see if there are any presenters or presentations that look like they fit those things that you think you might want to learn. Because if it&#8217;s not working for you, if it&#8217;s not teaching you something, then you don&#8217;t necessarily need to be in that one. Even if you&#8217;re not sure about a session a talk that you&#8217;re planning to go to, I recommend that you stop by, and then if you find out that it&#8217;s not for you, you can leave again.  That&#8217;s fine. But I do encourage you to go to at least one thing that feels a little bit outside of your comfort zone. Even if you feel lost right now. It at least gives you an idea of what to search for once you do get to that point. I would never have known the things to search for early on in my learning of WordPress without going to at least one or two sessions that were just way over my head. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:14] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Second thing is don&#8217;t forget to check when lunch is available. And if you have dietary restrictions, let them know ahead of time. I realize this sounds silly, and I don&#8217;t know about you, but I can&#8217;t focus when I&#8217;m hungry. But also, it&#8217;s really a great, low-stakes networking time, and I think one of the overlooked networking times as well. I mean, everyone&#8217;s gotta eat, right? And it&#8217;s easier to strike up a conversation over a meal than just out of thin air or, you know, in the middle of a presentation when you&#8217;re supposed to be listening to a talk. So yeah, check out when lunch is happening! And yeah, make a friend or two, sit down at a table, and ask somebody what they&#8217;re doing with WordPress and how long they&#8217;ve been doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing that I would recommend that you do when you&#8217;re looking at kind of the main event for a WordCamp is to schedule in time to wander around and meet the event sponsors. They are all experts in some WordPress problem or other, so probably they have a solution to a problem that you have got. But they&#8217;re also how we keep our prices super low, so even if you have no problems or you think you have no problems. Still, check them out. They&#8217;re also staffed with wonderful people that are building really cool stuff with WordPress and so you might just get some inspiration out there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Now for the side events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the side events, we&#8217;re going to kind of start close to the main event and work our way out. So you&#8217;ve got generally three types of side events if you don&#8217;t count the networking things, which, in this case, I&#8217;m not. But just know that almost every WordCamp has some networking event, either an after-party or, like, a happy hour, a social that happens before the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll get emails about those if you have signed up for updates on the website. Also, you can look on the website directly. Just check out the schedule. Always go to those. The networking is the best at a WordCamp. But the side events—we&#8217;re talking about specific types. Like I said, we&#8217;re going to start close and work our way out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, workshops. These are just what they sound like. They&#8217;re classroom-style opportunities to practice the things you&#8217;ve learned at meetup events or on learn.WordPress.org, depending on how you found your way to this WordCamp. They mostly happen during the WordCamp itself. in a separate track, and there are like stacks of workshops in that track in that series of sessions. But a lot of them do require preregistration simply so that the trainer has an idea of how many people to expect. Again, if you get in the workshop and it&#8217;s way over your head, you feel like you absolutely cannot get it done, you&#8217;re always welcome to leave and check out some other area. But, in general, the workshops that we have WordCamps are pretty solid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a little bit further removed from that are our Youth and Teen Days. So this is more of an event series that is specifically designed for teens or kids who are trying to learn more about WordPress and other related business and entrepreneurial topics. It&#8217;s kind of a catch all but also has a lot of WordPress content in it. They have age limits, of course, and require separate registration for safety and planning purposes both. And those, in general, are either half-day during the WordCamp itself or a full-day during that WordCamp. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us then to the big one, the major side event. This is a full-day side event called Contributor Day. If your WordCamp has a Contributor Day, it will happen either the day before or the day after the WordCamp itself. It is an entire day where attendees come together to learn how to contribute to the future of the WordPress open source project. Now, if you are listening to this as part of, like, you&#8217;re getting ready to go to a WordCamp, and you don&#8217;t know what I meant by open source or open source project or WordPress open source project, that&#8217;s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> You&#8217;re going to learn all about it at the Contributor Day if you go, but the TLDR is that this software that you are about to choose to build your website on is built by thousands of people across the planet who are looking for the best solutions to problems that they have in their businesses that probably you will encounter or have encountered before. There&#8217;s no new problems under the sun, and open source methodologies kind of use the collective wisdom of everybody who has ever worked with a WordPress project or site and ran into a problem that they had to solve on their own, like this open source project, this community of people just make sure that that wisdom is collected and standardized and made available for all of eternity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all you need to know. Low key. I&#8217;ve made Contributor Days sound so calming. However, that is a whole day thing. It happens before or after the WordCamp. It has separate registration so that organizers of your WordCamp can plan for how many folks need to be there to teach new and returning contributors, what to do. If I&#8217;m going to be honest, if you&#8217;re going to get overwhelmed at any WordPress event, it&#8217;s going to be one of these, but they are well worth the effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Even if you just make a single contribution and never return, which I hope is not the case for you. I hope you do return. Even if you make a single contribution and never return, there&#8217;s something really grounding about seeing how much expertise and time, and care goes into this software that is, against all odds, completely free. So that&#8217;s all the tactical stuff, or a lot of it anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It at least gives you a sense for what you&#8217;re getting yourself into for your first-ever wonderful WordPress weekend. But I promised you some human stuff too. So here is my considerably shorter list of stuff to bring as a human being going to a WordCamp. There&#8217;s an optional one. I&#8217;ll start you off with an optional one. Come with an idea of what you think you want to learn. You don&#8217;t have to come with that if you don&#8217;t want to. Some of us don&#8217;t know what we don&#8217;t know yet, and that&#8217;s fine too. But if you have a sense for what you think you need to learn, you&#8217;ll have an easier time figuring out how to spend your time while you&#8217;re here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, the non-optional things. Bring some way to exchange information. It can be QR codes, business cards, or pen and paper. It doesn&#8217;t really matter as long as it&#8217;s something that works for you to be sharing information with people that you meet. Because you never know when you&#8217;re going to meet your business soulmate, but the odds that you&#8217;re going to do it at a WordCamp are pretty dang high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing to bring is bring what you need to be comfortable. Bring your water bottle, a change of shoes if you need it, spare battery for your phone, your glasses. This day is going to be long enough without worrying about small inconveniences. So bring what you need to make yourself comfortable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And finally bring your bravery. You will not know by looking at someone whether they&#8217;ve been doing WordPress stuff for two years or two weeks. But you can know that at some point, they were in the first two days of trying to figure this all out. One of the most endearing things about this community is the zeal they bring to solving a problem. So if you get lost or stuck, just ask the person next to you. We all remember what it was like to know nothing, and we are rooting for you to succeed. And that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s your whole list. That&#8217;s everything you need to know to be the most prepared first-time attendee to a WordCamp ever. If that all sounded more overwhelming than just showing up, don&#8217;t worry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also just show up. That&#8217;s what I did. And even though I knew next to nothing, those WordCampers made me feel welcome and included and kept me coming back to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Ah, WordCamps. Gosh, I love those things. So glad that we&#8217;re all getting back together for them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] (Music interlude) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings us now, my friends, to our small list of big things. If you&#8217;re a first-time WordPresser, if you&#8217;ve never been to a WordCamp, and you don&#8217;t know what any of these things are, don&#8217;t worry; you can still go take a look at them, or you can wait until later when you&#8217;re less overwhelmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, but this is our small list of big things for middle of the year 2024. First thing on my list, the gender equality in WordPress businesses survey is still open. It aims to gain critical insight into the gender composition of leadership teams, the experiences of women and gender-diverse leaders and employees, and also take a look at the challenges and barriers to their career success. I care deeply about making sure that we have a way for folks who are traditionally and historically underrepresented in technology have a way to get into our space. Obviously, women and nonbinary folks are an area that I feel particularly called to help build those on-ramps for, but I have a great concern for that across the entire ecosystem and any intersection that we run into as we get more and more users into our space. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> If you are a woman, if you work with women, if you work in WordPress, if you work in a WordPress business, go take that survey, and let&#8217;s see what we find out about what it&#8217;s like to work in this space, as somebody that we normally don&#8217;t see. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our list is that WordCamp Asia 2025 dates and venue have been revealed. So WordCamp Asia 2023 and 2024 were both major successes, and we are excited to share that the dates and venue for next year will be February 20th, 21st, 22nd in 2025 in Manila, and you&#8217;ll be able to go over to that website, take a look at it, we&#8217;ll have a link in the show notes as always and maybe start planning your your next big Asian adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing on my list is this new contributor wizard questionnaire. So, there are more than 20 teams to contribute to in the WordPress project. They all show up at those Contributor Days that I talked about. But there are more than 20 of them. They work on different parts of the WordPress project every day. And our passionate community offers contribution opportunities for everyone. I know, we know, that finding the right team is the key to a meaningful contributor experience. So, our interactive questionnaire is here to help you determine where to start. It is sometimes difficult to know whether you can contribute to a software if you are a designer, if you are a writer, if you are in marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it turns out that you can contribute to WordPress with a bunch of skills that you otherwise would not have realized. So, we&#8217;ll have a link to the questionnaire in the show notes again. Also, it&#8217;s probably going to pop up on WordCamp sites, Contributor Day sites, anything that helps you all understand where you might find a little bit of success as a contributor is a good place for it to be. Take the questionnaire, see where you land, the WordPress sorting hat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And item number four. So we&#8217;ve made some updates, not we&#8217;ve made some updates, we have some updates from the Five for the Future program. So the Five for the Future program has a long history in the WordPress project. There are a couple of different episodes in this podcast where you can learn more about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, to bolster transparency and openness, we have an update on the current state of WordPress contributions as of the end of May 2024. In the past few months, we&#8217;ve made a lot of efforts to improve the program and contributor experience in WordPress. We&#8217;ve also done a little bit of work to kind of clean up the pledges that are in there for, people or companies or teams that have found that they couldn&#8217;t continue their contributions over time. That is fine too. But we&#8217;ll have a link to that update in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser. Or, if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at WPBriefing@WordPress.org. I am your host, Josepha Haden Chomposy. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:36] (Music outro) </p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"17352\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"WordPress 6.5.4 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/06/wordpress-6-5-4-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 15:57:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=17340\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:345:\"WordPress 6.5.4 is now available!This minor release features 5 bug fixes in Core.

Please follow the project&#8217;s responsible-disclosure practices detailed on this <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/wordpress\">HackerOne page</a> and in this <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/security/\">security white paper</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s coming to WordPress 6.6?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s second major release is about polish and finesse. Features that landed in the last few releases have new flexibility and smoother flows—and a few new tricks. And of course there are a few brand-new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data Views updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the groundwork for phase 3, Data Views get new and improved experience of working with information in the Site Editor. A new layout consolidates patterns and template parts, gets you to general management views in fewer clicks, and packs in a wide range of refinements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Overrides in synced patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you could keep a synced pattern‘s <em>look and feel</em> everywhere it appears—keeping it on brand—but have different <em>content</em> everywhere it appears?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, maybe you‘re building a pattern for recipes. Ideally, you want to keep the overall design of the recipe card consistent on every post that will have a recipe. But the recipe itself—the ingredients, the steps, special notes on technique—will be different every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And perhaps, in the future, other people might need to change the design of the recipe pattern. It would be nice to know they can do that, and that the content in existing recipes will stay right where it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In version 6.6, you can make all that happen, and overrides in synced patterns are the way you do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">See all the blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to now, when you had a block selected and then opened the block Inserter, you only saw the blocks you were allowed to add to your selected block. Where were all the others?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 6.6, when you have a block selected, you get two lists. First, there&#8217;s the list of blocks you can insert at your selected block. Then you get a list with all the other blocks. So you can get an idea of what you can use in your selected block, and what other blocks you could use in another area. In fact, if you select a block from that second list, WordPress 6.6 will add it below your block, to use in whatever you build next.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A new publish flow</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 6.6 brings the post and site editors closer together than ever. So whether you’re writing for a post in the post editor or a page in the Site Editor, your experience will be about the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Style variations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If a block theme comes with style variations, 6.6 vastly expands your design options right out of the box, without installing or configuring a single thing. Because in 6.6, your theme  pulls the color palettes and typography style sets out of its installed variations to let you mix and match for a whole world of expanded creative expression.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Section styles </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you build themes? Now you can define style options for separate sections of multiple blocks, including inner blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then your users can apply those block style variations to entire groups of blocks, effectively creating branded sections they can curate across a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A note about CSS specificity</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To make it easier for your variations to override the global styles CSS, those styles now come wrapped in `:root`. That limits their specificity. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/61810\">For details, read the full discussion on GitHub.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A native Grid layout</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Grid is a new variation for the Group block that lets you arrange the blocks inside it as a grid. If you&#8217;ve been using a plugin for this, now you can make your grids natively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Better pattern management in Classic themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You heard right: You can do everything with patterns in Classic themes that you can in a block theme. You can see all the patterns available to you in a single view and insert a pattern on the fly. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Negative. Margins.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re here: negative margin values, so you can make objects overlap in your design. As a guardrail, you can only set a negative margin by typing an actual negative number, not by using the slider. That’s to keep people from adding negative values they didn&#8217;t intend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rollback auto-updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can have the convenience of setting all your plugins to auto-update and the inner peace you get from knowing that if anything goes wrong, 6.6 will do a rollback. Automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This post <strong><em>reflects the latest changes</em></strong> as of June 4, 2024.</em></strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Again, the features in this first beta may change, based on what testers like you find.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get an overview of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-6/\">6.6 release cycle</a>, and check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/6-6/\">6.6-related posts</a> in the next few weeks for further details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Just for you: a Beta 1 haiku</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Negative margins<br>Embellish all the new ways<br>To design and build  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left is-style-default\"><em>Thanks very much to <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/audrasjb/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>audrasjb</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/fabiankaegy/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>fabiankaegy</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/colorful-tones/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>colorful-tones</a>, </em><a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/davidbaumwald/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>davidbaumwald</a>,<em> <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/dansoschin/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>dansoschin</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/desrosj/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>desrosj</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/atachibana/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>atachibana</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/ehtis/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>ehtis</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/adamsilverstein/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>adamsilverstein</a>, <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>joedolson</a>, and <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a> for reviewing and collaborating on this post!</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"17289\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"https://wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:4:\"site\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"14607090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:48:\"WpOrg\\Requests\\Utility\\CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:12:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 15:17:32 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:4:\"vary\";s:37:\"Accept-Encoding, accept, content-type\";s:25:\"strict-transport-security\";s:12:\"max-age=3600\";s:6:\"x-olaf\";s:3:\"⛄\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Tue, 02 Jul 2024 17:09:27 GMT\";s:4:\"link\";s:63:\"<https://wordpress.org/news/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:2:\"br\";s:7:\"alt-svc\";s:19:\"h3=\":443\"; ma=86400\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211220193300\";}','off'),

I wanted to pull a bit from that before I bring you to-date.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-my-first-thoughts-on-community-and-noise\">My first thoughts on community and noise</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dated October 20, 2020</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow comes the official launch of this new site. And let me tell you, it’s been an amazing journey of learning and understanding myself as well as the audience I will be speaking to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting aspect of this is the main goal, connecting the Woo builder community. I talked about this on a previous post, but I would like to dive into the concept of connecting. And conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I was asked about  groups for Do the Woo</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What brought the idea of Facebook groups to mind was something that happened as I have been chatting with various people about my new site. When I talk about connections, conversation and community, a few times I was asked,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you creating a Slack Channel? Starting a Facebook group? Perhaps a forum? Where are you growing your community and letting them have a conversation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we go into or lurk in community chats, whether it’s a Facebook group, regular chatter on any social platform or even Slack, often we end up in the middle of a massive amount of noise. There is a lot going on. Conversations going left and right. Sometimes with a bit of anxiety, bitterness, and yes, anger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I’m not saying that nothing good comes out of these conversations. But that isn’t the only way to connect and grow a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can start with this, the art of listening. Remember when that was part of connecting? Taking the time to listen to someone else share their insights and perspectives. Getting a better understanding of that person, and often, the community they are representing. In fact, get three people together for a good conversation and I can guarantee that you will get a lot more out of it vs. endless streams and threads of online chatter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take it a step further, though: personal connection. Learning about someone and then reaching out to them. Or perhaps, even having a connector that will help to introduce you to others in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that’s it. I am the connector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s via a podcast conversation or a post interview, I am connecting you to a new face. Or it might even be me connecting you personally with someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get enough of that noise, or what you might consider chatter amongst dozens of people via social and other platforms. And yes, I enjoy that. But with Do the Woo, I am cutting through that noise while bringing the Woo builder community together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in the end, when I do conversations, they are one-on-one. A Zoom chat. A DM on Slack. Email and a variety of other ways. The point is, again, no matter how or where you do it, listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-now-it-s-today\">Now it&#8217;s today</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So I was hoping as you read that you hung onto the fact that I wrote this over three years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, it has since resonated with me and, to be honest, I think it has always been a part of how I have built my own communities. The fact is we all do it in some way. For Woo builders, while keeping it on the business side of things, it may be a community of customers or clients. It may also be a community within a business you work for, or perhaps, colleagues of yours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also build communities around you brand or business on your site, on social, on Slack, you name it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are community experts out there that will give you advice. There are also social media consultants that will do the same, specifically for social communities. The thing is that one size doesn&#8217;t fit all. And often that is what you will discover over and over when seeking advice on building your own community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been building community long before I got into the WordPress space in 2006. With our other business, there were ways that we built our community, and some of this was long before we did it online. I don&#8217;t proclaim to be an expert on community building, but I can share my own experiences that have worked for me. No promises here that I will deliver the perfect piece of advice for your needs, but I am hoping this will give you a bit of a different perspective on community building and something to ponder on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-community-does-not-need-a-bunch-of-noise\">A community does not need a bunch of noise</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now before I get into this part, understand that this is how it works for me, and in these last few years with Do the Woo, it has proven right for me. And by no means am I saying it&#8217;s the right way, or the only way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just feel that a lot of people never think about other options when building community. They tend to &#8220;jump on the bandwagon&#8221; of <em>engagement</em> and <em>active conversation</em> as the only way to build all communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-engage-or-die\">Engage, or die</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Community and social media experts say you must engage. Or else why do it? Your community will not thrive without this engagement. It often is literally rammed down your throat. At the same time, engagement isn&#8217;t always clearly defined, and seen as this constant need to reply, comment and add your own opinion, advice or simply be part of the conversation, no matter what.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, I have seen social media experts take &#8220;engagement&#8221; to a new and disturbing level. They constantly drop into conversations with replies like &#8220;nice&#8221;, &#8220;that&#8217;s great&#8221;, &#8220;cool&#8221; and &#8220;yeah&#8221;. If that is considered engagement, well, count me out. In fact, shouldn&#8217;t engagement also mean bringing value to a conversation. Not simple, meaningless replies that help you as they build up your metrics in your social media engagements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-everyone-has-an-opinion\">Everyone has an opinion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the beauty of the human race. We all have an opinion and can freely express it. But on the other hand, at times, it&#8217;s nothing but added noise. How often do you see a thread of a conversation and it appears that most of the comments are left by people who never read what others have said. And alarmingly, more people appear to never have read the original comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, it comes across as being all about &#8220;you&#8221;. You and what your opinion. It&#8217;s like a freaking room of people just shouting out what they are thinking, and ignoring everyone else. Nothing gets resolved and more times than not, it can turn sideways and end up being a never-ending debate or argument, instead of a discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now with both engagement and conversations, it&#8217;s not cut and dry. And neither of them are something that you should consider totally dismissing. In fact, depending on the goal of your own community, you may just ignore the advice I have given you so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that all said, I simply bring these up to give you another thought to ponder on as you build your own community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-where-is-this-all-going\">Where is this all going</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This has turned into quite the long post and if you are still with me, I&#8217;m amazed. But hey, it also means you are listening, or perhaps, reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do the Woo now has 14 co-hosts and more coming on board. On top of that I am constantly having people come in and host their own show, more of a one-off opportunity. And who knows what is next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact is that each time you hear a show on Do the Woo, and you don&#8217;t hear me, well, that&#8217;s because I was listening. Behind the scenes, taking notes, and enjoying the conversations. Sure there is what you might consider noise in our community, but it&#8217;s softer, more viable and easy to focus on. There is a time and place for lots of noise in many communities, and that is where it will thrive and stay.

Although I had not been traveling as much over the years prior to COVID, still, I found myself reaching out to more people online. More one-to-one conversations. More digital meetups. More forms of smaller online events. But, to be honest, I probably connected more with the community that than I have in any of the previous years in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During that same year I found myself burning out on content creation around blog post tutorials. I have done these for years and I just couldn&#8217;t poke one more out at the keyboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I decided to focus on more community-focused content, such as my podcasts and virtual meetings. It became a natural marriage of content and community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-between-now-and-then\">Between now and then</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So on reflection, this was one of the best moves I have made in my WordPress career. I continued on building the community at Do the Woo. Online connections grew, and then when IRL events started back up, well, they blossomed. That tie between content and commiunity have grown to be such a huge part of Do the Woo, and everything I do these days. And now on to 2024, the biggest year yet for Do the Woo.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 14:00:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"Do The Woo Community: 16 Years Later, the WordPress Origin Story by BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=3325\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://dothewoo.io/16-years-later-my-wordpress-story/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4535:\"<p>As I celebrate my own birthday today, many more than 20, I am reflecting on the years WordPress has been there for me. Oddly, I&#8217;m not sure where to begin except the beginning. And if I was to write a post to publish on the 20th anniversary of WordPress, it&#8217;s gotta be done here on BobWP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, there lies the fact that I just returned from WordCamp Lisboa where I gave a talk on 20 Years of WordPress community. So it&#8217;s a bit on my mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-george-clooney-was-named-people-s-sexiest-man-alive-and-i-discovered-wordpress\">George Clooney was named People’s sexiest man alive and I discovered WordPress </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These two events have nothing more in common than it was the same year, 2016. I can&#8217;t say I think George deserved it, but I had other things on my mind. In fact two things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First this was the year I became a bit intrigued with blogging. Nothing that had me gasping at the thought of writing posts, but simply a curiosity. At the same time I was trying to step into the world of web design as we had been running a marketing and design company for 13 years. And as much as building a site thrilled me, which was equal to having my hand smashed in a door, I figured there had to be a better way than html and flash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time drifted by. Judy had started a blog on Typepad and didn&#8217;t give a crap where it was. She just wanted to write. As I eased into the next year, WordPress slipped into my consciousness more and more. It seemed apparent that this thing called WordPress was going to become part of my life one way or another. Seriously though, I didn&#8217;t have a clue to what extent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the next few years, up to 2010, bit and pieces fell together. I found a theme on a fairly new site called iThemes. The concept of these seemed to be luring me into creating a site for our business that didn&#8217;t look like shit. And that&#8217;s exactly what WordPress and the Corporate theme from iThemes did for me. Without any freaking code!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The BobWP brand rises out of the ruins of ancient web design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I am avoiding going through my 16 years of WordPress history, simply for the reason that I cannot afford to lose you through my years of pivots, twists and turns. It may make you dizzy and I don&#8217;t want you vomiting before I wrap this up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But 2010 was the pivotal moment in my WordPress Story. Why? Well, I had been doing some blogging workshops the two years prior to that year. I was getting my feel for where I need to go with WordPress. I was starting to explore the community more and more from that day in 2006. And I liked what I saw.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the time came to make the transition from our marketing and design firm, Cat&#8217;s Eye Marketing, to something that would let me do my WordPressy thing, whatever that meant and wherever it led.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got rid of all our our &#8220;print&#8221; clients or the last few that we were hanging onto. Mentally I told myself I&#8217;m going all in on WordPress. Design, training and whatever else would come my way. And it was time to rebrand. Not the business, per se, but myself. I was going to be the brand. So after some contemplation, possible consumption of alcohol and severe mumbling to myself, I came up with BobWP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mmmmmmm. It was short and sweet. And the domain was available, go figure. But would people get it? Would someone that doesn&#8217;t know what I do, and doesn&#8217;t know WordPress find it to be puzzling? Would people say my business is Bobwup? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, those concerns and questions did not weigh heavily on me. Nor did the fact that I was tying myself into a personal brand, that, well, would likely die with me. I bought the domain, and made it happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you may know the rest, the rest is history.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I&#8217;m a WordPresser at heart</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I really do love the community. And at this point I&#8217;m here to stay. Right now I&#8217;m doing what motivates me the most. Connecting people. Raising voices. And meetings some of the coolest people I have ever known, both in these last 16 years and moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as much as I find it kind of weird singing Happy Birthday to my dashboard, my computer or any part of the software, or thinking that WordPress could be my grandchild, I will say this.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Happy 20th Anniversary, WordPress Community</h2>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 14:00:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"Do The Woo Community: Are We in WordPress Community Version 3.0?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=4975\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://dothewoo.io/are-we-in-wordpress-community-version-3-0/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3740:\"<p>I was recently on <a href=\"https://wpmainline.com/podcast/wp-mainline-episode-19-godaddy-acquires-pagely-doing-the-woo-and-wordpress-contributor-churn/\"><strong>Jeff&#8217;s podcast over at WPMainline</strong></a>. A good part of the conversation was about the GoDaddy acquisition of Pagely. We also chatted about community and how some frustrations have led to great people moving on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with the acquisitions, blocks, community disruption, etc. etc. etc., a thought occurred to me. We focus on the versions of WordPress, but what about community?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-three-versions-ago\">Three Versions Ago</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to think of it this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpress-community-version-1-0\">WordPress Community Version 1.0</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is when it all started. WordPress moved on from being a sparkle in Matt&#8217;s eye to something on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpress-community-version-2-0\">WordPress Community Version 2.0</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure exactly when this came out, but am looking at the 2007 &#8211; 2010 time frame. Why? This is when I started using WordPress. Ha. Well, that isn&#8217;t the reason. This was the time period a lot of the veterans in the space started up businesses. Or entered the space themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But more importantly I think around 2010 WordPress really started to gain traction. Why do I feel this way. From experience and having talked to others, this we a sweet spot. Where the rubber hit the highway. And again, from conversations with others, this seemed to be a ripe time to really dive into the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly, what followed in that time, I can guess that the community started kicking up a few notches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpress-community-version-3-0\">WordPress Community Version 3.0</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This one happened in the last couple of years, or maybe when 5.0 came out for WordPress. This is when the stuff hit the fan. More rapid innovation and more rustling in the community. Acquisitions are on the journey to become a norm. Rumblings were hot and heavy. And the community, well, started feeling different. Depending on who you are and what you perceive, those feelings where either really good, kind of sucky or a mix of everything between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now rest assure, this is something that came to me as I was driving back from the grocery store at 7:30 am while having just listened to Cory from Post Status talk to Josh from Pagely about the acquisition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose I could go on to fill a lot of versions of the community between those versions. That would be fun, but obviously time-consuming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All I know is that I am curious now about version 4.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update/Sidenote:</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had the chance to go on the<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-excerpt-no-41-wordpress-community-versions-past-present-future/\"><strong> Post Status podcast and take a deep-dive with David Bisset on this topic</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here is a poll he took on Twitter with some interesting results and comments as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> folks: based on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobWP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BobWP</a> post here what WP generation do you feel you belong to?<a href=\"https://t.co/bjNynPvjL6\">https://t.co/bjNynPvjL6</a></p>&mdash; David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/1476956055448006656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 31, 2021</a></blockquote>\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 14:00:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WPTavern: #126 – Aaron Jorbin on Navigating WordPress Major and Minor Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=156753\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/126-aaron-jorbin-on-navigating-wordpress-major-and-minor-releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44100:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how WordPress gets updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature in the podcast while I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Aaron Jorbin. Aaron has led teams responsible for some of the largest and most prominent WordPress sites in the world, including Rolling Stone, Variety, WIRED, The New Yorker and The White House. He&#8217;s also a WordPress Core committer who focuses on improving developer happiness, and making the internet usable by everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s been an integral part of the WordPress community since 2010, and today Aaron opens up about the crucial importance of major and minor WordPress releases, and the need for user trust, which forms the backbone for features like auto updates that enhanced WordPress security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the process behind WordPress releases, discussing how major and minor releases a planned and executed. Aaron explains the dynamics of the Core Committer community, a group of around a hundred dedicated individuals, about 50 of whom are currently active, whose decisions and hard work keep WordPress robust up to date and secure. The commitment to transparency, minimal egos, and the ability to handle criticism are mentioned as key elements for maintaining trust inside this community within a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about how communication and decision-making take place mostly in public forums, ensuring openness and collaboration. The conversation also touches on the ebb and flow of volunteer and sponsored contributors. The challenges of coordinating across global time zones, and the need for asynchronous decision-making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron explains what it takes to move from a small contributor to a key player in the WordPress ecosystem, emphasizing the burden of responsibility that comes with making changes affecting millions of non-technical users. Whether you&#8217;re a developer tester or enthusiastic user, Aaron encourages contributions in various forms, from sharing ideas to testing and providing feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered how WordPress is maintained and updated, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Aaron Jorbin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Aaron Jorbin. Hello Aaron.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:42] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> Hello Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> This is going to be a really interesting episode, and I confess, dear listener, that this is an episode that I basically know almost nothing about. So everything that comes out of Aaron&#8217;s mouth is going to be schooling me in a process that I know nothing about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it is probably the most important process. Without the process that we&#8217;re going to discuss today, the entire enterprise of WordPress doesn&#8217;t exist, because we&#8217;re going to be talking about the way that WordPress is released, goes from one version to another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get into the meat of the podcast though, Aaron, can I just offer you the opportunity to tell us a little bit about yourself, who you are, where you come from, where you are at the moment, because that&#8217;s kind of interesting, and what your role in the WordPress community is, please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:26] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> So I am Aaron Jorbin. I have been a Core contributor since 2010, and have been involved in WordPress since about a year or two before that. I went to a WordPress meetup and got sucked into the community, got lucky. And it was right before WordCamp Portland 2009, which was sold out in like three hours. And so I had not gotten a ticket, and there was a raffle for tickets. And so I was able to win the raffle and get a ticket, and get to go to a WordCamp, and start meeting the people that I had known from IRC in real life, and got brought in then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my role, I am one of the Core committers, so I&#8217;m one of the one hundred or so people that can make changes to WordPress Core itself. And for the last year, I&#8217;ve been specifically focusing on the minor releases of WordPress, so the maintenance and security releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these are ones that are much smaller in scope, these aren&#8217;t bringing in new features, but in my opinion, some of the more important ones. They&#8217;re the ones that are auto updated by default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the changes that we make in these releases go to every site. And it is a terrifying moment when you start rolling them out, and you just have to cross your fingers that everything is going to go smooth. And so we&#8217;ve put a lot of processes in place to help them go as smooth as they possibly can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That has been my main focus, but I&#8217;ve also worked a lot on the build tools of WordPress, and on the more low down systems. I haven&#8217;t done a lot with many user facing features. I think the last user facing feature that I had a heavy hand in was the ability to log out of other, where you were logged in elsewhere. And we did user testing for that at the final WordCamp San Francisco, so I think that was 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Honestly, what a fascinating story. Can I just ask though, if we go back to 2010, I think that was the year that you said you began your WordPress journey. So it&#8217;s a long time, you&#8217;ve been doing this software now for 14 years. What was the path of escalation that took you from, I&#8217;m brand new to WordPress, to Core Committer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it feels like, if you&#8217;re into the software of WordPress, Core Committer is, that&#8217;s like where the road ends. There&#8217;s not really too many places to go beyond there. You know, you&#8217;ve got the capacity to improve WordPress. You could destroy it if you so wish to. So how did that path happen? And I&#8217;m guessing it was a sort of slow, incremental community journey, but I&#8217;d love to hear that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:07] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> Yeah, so my first code contribution was, so Jen Milo, who was at the time the UX lead of WordPress. She published a blog post about a few small UX changes she would like to see in WordPress Core. And I was like, well, I&#8217;ve got some extra time on my hands. I&#8217;m going to try to work on one of these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I sat down for a couple of days, and worked on the initial patch for it, and went back and forth with Andrew Nacin, who was a new committer at that time, and we came up with a solution. This was during the 3.0 cycle, and it was for the ability for you to see, if you attempted to change the admin email in WordPress, it sends an email that you need to confirm, but there was no notice whatsoever that there was a pending change. So it was just adding a notice that there was a pending change, so you could know that someone had tried to change it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, worked on that, and that got accepted. I was very excited. I ran home to my then girlfriend, and told her, oh my God, oh my God, you&#8217;re not going to understand any of this, because she was not a techie. This is what I did. My code is now going to help power almost 20% of the internet. That also shows how old this was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there it was, well, now I&#8217;ve seen this process, now I&#8217;ve been involved in this process, what can I do to continue being involved in this process? And so I was working on a few small enhancements, or bug fixes, every release. And did that for, probably about three years before I got a job at Condé Nast, the magazine publisher. And part of my role there was to really help the company used WordPress better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that gave me a lot of freedom and time, and I found one of the best uses of that time was to help make WordPress itself better. If it&#8217;s better for Condé Nast, it&#8217;s probably going to be better for everyone. And at the time, one of the challenges, it was right as the Git mirrors were added for WordPress. And I was like, okay well, now we have patches that are coming in through Git, coming in through SVN, coming in against the old Core repo, versus against the modern develop repo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I worked on a tool called Grunt Patch WordPress, that made it easy for you to apply patches from anywhere. And you could just enter a ticket number, it would list all of the patches, and it would apply it automatically, no matter how it had been created. And working on that, I got involved more in the build tools, and was asked during the 4.1 cycle, if I would be willing to become a committer, and if I was willing to help maintain WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was a huge honour, and a huge burden that I would be willing to take on. My friend Daniel Bachhuber gave a talk a number of years ago, my condolences, you are now the maintainer of an open source software project. And in many ways, like you are taking on a great weight. Your changes are going to affect other people, and you are going to be responsible for making these changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is still an honour that the community and other committers trust me enough to stay in this role, and that I have been able to make a number of changes, and hopefully make WordPress better in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It is such an interesting tale that. And really, I think the word that&#8217;s coming out of it for me was one that you just said, and it was trust. It feels like this whole process, from 2010 until the moment you were offered the Core Commiter status, it feels like it&#8217;s a work of building up trust, of doing things in a way which is fully transparent. People can see what you&#8217;re doing. You&#8217;ve done something important. Things worked, I guess, as well. And over time, people just begin to say, oh okay, yeah, Aaron, oh yeah, his name&#8217;s come up a little bit. And then eventually, that moment where you get the ability to alter WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I guess the journey between 2010, okay, it was 20% of the internet. It was still big. But it&#8217;s like going from 20 to 43, let&#8217;s say about there at the moment. That&#8217;s a big jump. To be approaching half of the internet is incredible. And you illustrated, or you alluded to the fact that you sometimes probably feel the burden of that a little bit. You commit something, and millions of people are going to feel the effect of that. And millions of them will be utterly non-technical. And so they will not know when something goes wrong. They will not understand where to go and seek resolution to that, potentially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that must add to the burden even more because, you know, if something goes wrong at my local shop, I just take it back and get another one. If something goes wrong with a website and I&#8217;m non-technical, then, yeah, that&#8217;s really interesting. So trust is what I&#8217;m imagining is the sort of essence of what you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:14] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> Yes. So ultimately, user trust matters. I think it was Andrew Nacin who first said to me that, what makes WordPress work as well as it does, is the trust the users place in the software. The fact that users trust WordPress to auto update. Without auto updates, WordPress would be less secure. Without the ability to have a bug fix, or a security bug fix go out nearly instantaneously, it would be weeks before many people logged into WordPress. Potentially, you know, some people will set up a site, and set it and forget it. And they would get hacked if it wasn&#8217;t for auto updates. And so having that user trust really is a requirement for WordPress to be as successful as it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So there&#8217;s the trust from the community, but also presumably there must be a fairly high level of trust between you Core Commiters. And I think you said about the number 100, something like that. Have I got that right? Is it roughly around there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:17] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> It is about a hundred people that have committed over the course of the 21 years that WordPress has been involved. I think there&#8217;s about 50 active at the moment in some way, shape, or form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But a hundred broadly speaking, over the course of WordPress, and maybe 50 at the moment. I guess the trust between all of you must be fairly high. And I presume you must have back channels. Well, of course you do. But I&#8217;m really just leading you down the garden path of, tell us what these are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you communicate? How do you maintain that trust? Is the trust, dare I ask it, is the trust ever taken away, and somebody has to be removed from that role? So yeah, let&#8217;s just get into that. How do you communicate? How do you ensure that trust is kept going? What are the ways that you build all of that up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:03] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> First off, there&#8217;s very little back channel. There&#8217;s very little that is not discussed in the open, related to WordPress Core. Security is about the only thing that does not get discussed openly. Otherwise, there might be some conversations, especially when things are just not known. When people have, what I would refer to as a very half-baked idea. You might back channel, and have a quick side discussion with one or two other people, to try to make that idea a little bit better, so that you don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re going to embarrass yourself by sharing the idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than that, it is all in public. It is in Slack, it is on Trac tickets , it is on GitHub issues, it is on pull requests. That discussion is happening in public, and is open for anyone to really contribute their thoughts and their ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And where the trust amongst us comes in, is the fact that I think, generally, there is very little ego involved in the people that are committers. We don&#8217;t feel bad if another person tells us our idea was wrong, or our idea isn&#8217;t the right solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is okay for someone to tell me that my code is, bad or that my code doesn&#8217;t solve the problem. That&#8217;s not an insult to me personally. I think that all of the committers, there&#8217;s that idea that we are all going to be okay. We&#8217;re not going to insult each other. It&#8217;s not an instance of, what idiot made that decision? That&#8217;s not the type of thing that would ever be said amongst committers. It&#8217;s, okay, what information was had that guided that decision? How can we improve that information?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Does the Core Commiter community, you mentioned that it was, over time it&#8217;s been a hundred, and at the moment it&#8217;s 50. Does it ebb and flow a little bit? In other words, are there people who just take a step back, maybe come back in six months time or something? Or are many of those people in some way able to commit to Core on a more or less permanent basis because, I don&#8217;t know, maybe they&#8217;re sponsored, or seconded by their company or something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:08] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> Yeah so, I mean, I would say most of the people that are active are given support in some way, shape, or form. So myself, I have GitHub sponsors that, right now, are covering a portion of my life expenses. But others are paid full-time, whether it be by a hosting company, by a product company. And so most of the people that are active are supported, but not all of them. There are a number of committers that are still doing this on a very volunteer basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people&#8217;s activity does ebb and flow. And so, I think a good example of this is myself. So I was very active, especially during the 4.1 to about 4.9 timeframe. But then I took on a different role, and didn&#8217;t have as much time. And so I stepped back from necessarily doing as many active commits, and more was there to help be in meetings, and provide some historical context, or to work on a couple of small things here or there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then after I left my most recent job, I was like, I&#8217;m taking a break. I stopped looking at computer screens for nearly six months. It was incredible. But decided that, ultimately, I like WordPress. I like contributing to what I view as a very important mission to democratise publishing. I think that, even if I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with everything everyone has to say online, I think they have a right to share it and a right to say it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to help people do that. I want to help, whether it be a small business that just wants to get word out about its hours, to a large media company that wants to do journalism, to politicians who I may or may not agree with, wanting to get elected. I think that everyone has a right to share their beliefs online, and WordPress helps unlock that, and I like working on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nice. I think, if we were to poll every single person that&#8217;s used WordPress ever, which should be a difficult thing to do, but let&#8217;s imagine that we could. I&#8217;m imagining that the vast majority of those people would not necessarily have technical expertise or any interest in the project. They&#8217;re just using it, it&#8217;s functional to them. They may not even know that it&#8217;s called WordPress. They log into their website, and they do their thing. They create their content, and they click publish, and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yet It just magically updates itself from time to time, whether that&#8217;s at the click of a button, or something, a little bit more automated. It just sort of happens in the background. And also, I would imagine that the listeners to this podcast, even though it&#8217;s very likely that they&#8217;re really quite crazily into WordPress, there&#8217;ll be this curtain between what they experience, and what Core is doing. How all those decisions are made, and how those changes get pushed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, they may have noticed, obviously, that there are minor releases. So we go from 6.5, to 6.5.1, to 6.5.2, and then there are more major releases, 6.5 to 6.6, or 7 at some point, you know. But the major releases kind of have dates in the calendar, stretching right out into the future. So we try to get those dates for the whole year, and you can look those up online, and may provide that in the show notes. But you can see, in theory, they&#8217;re provided for. We&#8217;ve got a north star. We know that on this date we should be shipping the next version of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in between those major ones, we get these little ones which come around, like today. Little ones just happen, might happen in a week, might be two weeks, there might be a few weeks that go between them. How are those decisions made, and could we break it into the two parts? Could we do the major first, and then the minor afterwards? Because I think the major is more, how to describe it, there&#8217;s more thought goes into it on a long term basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s more north star of that, and the minor ones feel like sometimes it&#8217;s reactive instead of proactive, because of security and so on. So let&#8217;s do the major releases. How is it decided what features go in, what we&#8217;re aiming for, what we want to ship?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:05] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> So, I mean ultimately it&#8217;s decided what is going in by what is ready to go in, for a major release, and what people want to work on. Whether that is individuals that have a improvement that they really want to drive forward, whether it&#8217;s a company that decides that they want to donate, or devote, resources to working on maybe a larger feature that they think that will benefit their users, or hopefully benefit all users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decisions of what is ready to go in is basically a decision of the committers as a whole. And it&#8217;s often based on a consensus. And it&#8217;s not necessarily that everyone agrees, it&#8217;s that no one disagrees. So we will work in Slack, there will often be people that are guiding it. There are individuals that are wholly focused on just looking at the backlog of requests, and every idea that ever has been proposed. And saying like, okay well, this is a common theme, and this is a way to solve that problem. And we&#8217;ll be working towards that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so those major releases will often be set, generally by the project leadership, by Josepha and by Matt. And the dates might flux. Oftentimes we&#8217;re looking at trying to find a date that works for everyone in the world can be hard. There are holidays nearly everywhere, or nearly every day in some countries, and so trying to minimise the impact of those releases. And so not doing a release on a major Christian holiday, or a major Muslim holiday, is generally best possible solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the minor releases, like you said, there&#8217;s kind of the reactive ones, in which case, those would generally be decided sometimes hours ahead of time. In the case of 6.4.1 two weeks ahead of time in other cases. So the recent 6.5.3 there was about one month of process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And basically what it was was, it started with, some discussions in Slack of, okay, I think we&#8217;re going to want a maintenance release. Let&#8217;s try to put together a group of people that can lead it. And then, okay, amongst that group, let&#8217;s discuss possible dates. Let&#8217;s look at calendars. Let&#8217;s look at our personal calendars to make sure that we will be available. Let&#8217;s look at the holiday calendars to make sure that we&#8217;re not scheduling it during a bank holiday, or a religious holiday. And let&#8217;s try to do our best to make sure that people will be available for that release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as what goes into the minor releases, it&#8217;s a lot of times like what bugs are known, what bugs are people reporting, what things can we fix in that timeframe? And so, a way that people can get involved is, there will generally be a post on Make Core about the release, and if you don&#8217;t see one, there&#8217;s always the weekly Dev Chat agendas, where you can comment on there. And commenting about a bug of, I think that this bug needs to be fixed in this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We keep the scope rather tight, and that we try to focus the bug fixes solely on recently introduced bugs, rather than longer standing bugs, but anything can be discussed. If someone wants to try to make the case for it, they can try to make the case for it. The idea that, in the presence of new rationale, a good maintainer changes their mind often. And so even if the answer is initially no, that doesn&#8217;t mean the answer is no forever, and adding new information, adding data can really change minds a lot of times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You talked about a consensus there, and in fact, I think the implication of what you said was that, broadly speaking, the consensus is often there. There&#8217;s often broad consensus amongst you Core Committers about what needs to go in. In a way that kind of seems surprising, because you&#8217;d imagine that with 50 minds staring at a problem, there&#8217;s going to be 50 different solutions, and a lot of arguing and tussling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, again, I suppose that goes back to the trust thing that we talked about earlier, and maybe something different to trust, maybe it&#8217;s accommodation, or the ability to defer to somebody politely, as opposed to just wanting to railroad them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I feel maybe that in the corporate world, that whole governance model would break down reasonably quickly. Is that what you&#8217;re saying? That the 50 of you, or however many are in the, air quotes, room at the time, you really do have that? There is a consensus of almost everything that goes in. That&#8217;s remarkable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:46] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> I would say we get to consensus. There is not always one to begin with. There is absolutely disagreements that happen, and disagreements that take place. And I would say that there are very few changes that aren&#8217;t without some sort of, often minor, disagreement. Of whether it be, I think this line needs more documentation, or I don&#8217;t like the variable name used here, ultimately nitpicky things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the way up to major, I don&#8217;t think that this is something that should be in Core disagreements. And you will have discussions, and sometimes that discussion will peter out, and not necessarily get to a quick resolution. Oftentimes though it will get to a resolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And another saying that I often use to guide me is, no is temporary, but yes is forever. Saying that code is not ready for WordPress isn&#8217;t saying that this code is never going in WordPress, or this feature is never going in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s very few things I can think of that I would be like, this should never go into WordPress. But once it is in WordPress, it is the responsibility of all maintainers, all of the committers to maintain it, and to make it as best as it possibly can. Once it&#8217;s released from WordPress, because there will be features that are added that might get removed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think the font library is a good example of this. This was originally targeted for, I think, 6.3, and wasn&#8217;t quite ready. And then 6.4, it got very close, but then ultimately was pulled back. And then 6.5, after a lot of disagreement that people probably saw publicly amongst many committers, we did find solutions in a way to ship that, in a way that I think ultimately has been beneficial for the users of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is the release lead for each release, so that, let&#8217;s say, for example, 6.5 or 6.6, has a release lead. Is the release lead ultimately responsible for the go, no go decision? In other words, if the 50 of you are, yeah, you can&#8217;t quite get that consensus that would be lovely, then it falls on the shoulders of an individual, and if you follow the project, you&#8217;ll know that that individual changes from time to time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:05] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> Yeah. So, I mean ultimately it is Matt&#8217;s decision. And I for one, think that Matt has very good product sense, and WordPress is largely successful because of Matt. And I think that there are very few cases where I can think of where a problem has needed to be escalated to Matt to make a decision. Ultimately, you know, it&#8217;s often there will be a decision that gets made amongst the people that are most active, and working on it closely. And it&#8217;s not a highly conflicted situation. It&#8217;s very rare that the release lead needs to decide between two camps, if you will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think sometimes the impression, out in the wider world, probably not in the community of WordPressers who follow the project really, really closely, but I do wonder sometimes if there is an impression that decisions, like any hierarchy, there must be somebody at the top making all these decisions and what have you. So that&#8217;s really nice to hear. That&#8217;s nice to hear that you think that&#8217;s a fair and equitable way of doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I wonder how you feel about the, I can&#8217;t think of a better word, so I&#8217;m going to use the word chaos. The open source nature of the project can at times be fairly chaotic, because everybody gets a voice, everybody can put time into things, everybody can push their own agenda. I guess in a more corporate structure, it would be top down, whereas we&#8217;ve got a much flatter structure in WordPress. Everybody gets their go. Does it sometimes feel a little bit like that? And I&#8217;m not asking you to throw any names out, or throw anybody under a bus. But, does it occasionally feel, oh, can we just make the decision? Can we just do this, or this, which one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:45] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> I think chaos actually is a great term for it because it often is, and especially when working around the clock. There are people contributing in nearly every time zone. And I think you would struggle to find a time of day where someone isn&#8217;t working on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily there&#8217;s very few decisions that need to get made at a snap of a hat. It is almost always a case where the decisions can be made asynchronously, where the discussion can continue possibly over the course of multiple days, or weeks. And the chaos works. And I know that a lot of people struggle with the chaos, and with understanding, well, how can I get involved? Who&#8217;s the person in charge that I need to talk to? Everyone is in charge, so you talk to everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s not like if you&#8217;re in the corporate world where you just whip out the company Rolodex, for want of a better word, and you discover that, oh okay, they&#8217;re in charge of that department, that&#8217;s them. It&#8217;s a little bit more fine grain and nuanced, and things change all the time, and somebody&#8217;s gone on holiday. I love that then. So there is a kind of chaotic element to it, which I think you embrace, I guess. This is just the way it works, and it&#8217;s probably got massive upsides, as well as some interesting downsides as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the project, it feels like, since the dawn of the internet, so whenever that was, Tim Berners Lee, 35 years or whatever. Open source, at the beginning of the internet, was a real crucial underpinning for all sorts of things. The servers that we use, the CMSs that we use, and so open source projects just popped up everywhere. But then it feels, more recently, that competitive, market-based, commercial CMSs have come along, with probably a corporate governance structure. So not as transparent, but maybe more top down. So perhaps easier to manage in that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have any feelings, or misgivings about open source in the near future, because of the competitive landscape that a CMS finds itself in now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:50] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> I think that ultimately open source always wins. I think that you are better off betting on open source. I saw a tweet the other day about someone that has a shop on Shopify, and they woke up one morning and Shopify had turned them off. And they were like, well, our target was to make $25 million this year, but now it might be zero, because this decision by this company was to turn us off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thankfully with WordPress, you don&#8217;t have to deal with that. WordPress cannot turn a site off. WordPress cannot decide that a specific website is no longer going to be allowed to use WordPress. WordPress has the benefit of the GPL, GNU public license. And in that there are the four freedoms, and one of those is the freedom to run the software in any way you choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that freedom, I think, ultimately is what gives open source its power, and its sustainability. WordPress itself is a fork of another project. I am never upset if someone says, well, I&#8217;m going to fork WordPress to do this, it&#8217;s like, okay. If your software is going to be better, that&#8217;s awesome. Open source wins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not someone that&#8217;s ever been a big Drupal user, but I love Drupal. Drupal&#8217;s open source software. I don&#8217;t view Drupal as the enemy of WordPress. I think that, if a site wants to use Drupal because that&#8217;s the best open source software, or the best software it can find, awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has been lucky to, you know, at various times, collaborate with people in the Drupal community. A number of years ago, I was running the WordPress meetup in Washington DC, and we organised what we refer to as the open source barbecue. And so it was the WordPress meetup, the PHP meetup, the Android meetup, and the jQuery meetup. And we just threw a barbecue for 200 people to come and celebrate open source, and eat barbecue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If we were just concentrating on the features, so not the ethics of owning the technology, who owns it, who gets to shut you down or not. Do you think that it&#8217;s easy for an open source project, of the breadth, and scale, and depth, and enormity of WordPress, to keep up with the features that the proprietary CMSs ship? Because they know their users, and because they don&#8217;t have to make decisions in committee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, they probably do but, you know, the committees are probably much smaller, and managed from the top down. And they can ship features like this, and like that. They don&#8217;t need to necessarily worry. It&#8217;s a difficult question to encapsulate, but do you understand where I&#8217;m going with that? They can ship features perhaps more quickly than WordPress can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:33] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> Absolutely. But I don&#8217;t think it is the ability to ship features quickly that leads to success. I think it&#8217;s the ability to ship the right features, and provide the right experience for users. And I think that experience includes the ability for them to decide to move. If you are not happy with your WordPress host, you can move hosts. If you are not happy with the agency that you are using, you can move agencies. If you are using a closed source CMS, your ability to move is a lot harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get locked in, and ultimately that is harder for you. It might mean that you get features quicker. It might mean that you get up and running quicker, but at what cost? Everything has a benefit, everything has a cost. And I think that the benefits of open source just drastically outweigh the costs of using it. The fact that you are going to deal with volunteers running your software project in many cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s the old XKCD article, which has the tiny twig of holding up the software is one random guy in Omaha, Nebraska. And as much as possible, I think one of the benefits of WordPress is that there&#8217;s very few things where it&#8217;s one twig being held up by a single person. There are very few parts of the code base that multiple committers aren&#8217;t familiar with. And the beauty of how it&#8217;s been developed is we can look back in many cases, and understand why changes were made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll see in, if you ever look at a WordPress commit, there&#8217;s often be a long section. There will be a one sentence description, and then there might be a paragraph or two explaining what the change is. And then there&#8217;s also links to tickets, and often very important, the props of who worked on it along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you can see, okay, well, these 15 people contributed to this. Oh, 12 of them aren&#8217;t active anymore, but there&#8217;s 3 of them that are. Maybe they remember, or I can look at the tickets that are referenced, and I can find the discussion that took place leading up to it. And that ticket, maybe that links to an IRC conversation from 15 years ago. We have the logs of that conversation, and can look back at what was discussed, and how did we get to this solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think history shows that people seem to like open source. You only have to look at the numbers, and the enormity of a lot of open source projects to realise that it definitely tends towards winning. I don&#8217;t know quite how to phrase that but, does that make sense? The graph tends towards open source on the whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay so, Aaron, given all of this, if somebody&#8217;s listening to this and they think, actually, I&#8217;d like to get into that, I&#8217;d be curious to see what this is like, dip my feet. Nobody&#8217;s suggesting that you have to show up and stay there for the rest of your life but, how do people begin this journey? Where are the best places to go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:36] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> So if you want to contribute to WordPress Core, and I hope that everyone does at some point in their life, the best way to get started is to join the new contributor chats, which take place biweekly in WordPress Slack. And so if you go to make.wordpress.org/chat, you can join the WordPress Slack. If you go to make.wordpress.org/core, you can see the Core discussions, and you can see the meetings that are taking place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get involved. Find a issue that is bothering you, or that you think is going to make WordPress better, and add your thoughts. Think about like, if someone isn&#8217;t thinking about this, what is going to get them to think about this? Add context, add information. Even if you are not someone that can write code, maybe you can quickly sketch out an idea, take a picture of that and upload it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you can share some data or share some stats from your company of, hey, this change took place and it&#8217;s actually caused a 10% drop for us in user signups. That is like, okay, well, that&#8217;s a data point that we can look at, and maybe use to come up to a better solution. This change would help speed up our website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also test the changes that other people have proposed. There is the WordPress Playground now, that allows you to very easily test out a change. Just earlier today, there&#8217;s a change that was being proposed for 6.6 to remove the revisions panel from the sidebar. And a handful of us were like, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s quite right, here&#8217;s some alternate ideas. And then someone coded one up. A couple people looked at it and we&#8217;re like, that&#8217;s not the right way, how about this other way? And it was coded up, and I tested it and just was like, all right, here&#8217;s what I see. And it just took a couple of clicks of my mouse. It wasn&#8217;t a hard process to test and share a little bit of feedback for the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it&#8217;s not all about committing code. There are many more ways that you could help Core. So it may be that you identify problems, or test possible things that could go in, and just give your opinions. There&#8217;s loads of different ways that you can help in this initiative. And I will make sure that the, bits and pieces that Aaron has mentioned today all make it into the show notes. If you go to wptavern.com/podcast, and search for this episode, you&#8217;ll be able to find the show notes all attached there. It only remains for me, Aaron, to ask, if anybody is interested in just connecting with you personally, do you have a favorite place online where you send people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:16] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> My WordPress site is my favorite place, which is at aaron.jorb.in. I&#8217;m also on a number of social media networks, generally with the username of Aaron Jorbin. A handful of them I think I use just Jorbin. Yeah, I would love to chat with people. If people see me at a WordCamp, please come up and talk to me. I can be a bit of an introvert at those, and so I might not approach people, but would love to chat with as many people as I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something I used to do, that I&#8217;m going to try to get back into is, one lunch during the WordCamp, I&#8217;d sit down at a random table and just ask people, so how do you use WordPress? And you never know who you&#8217;re going to meet, and what they&#8217;re going to have to share if you do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s nice. And by the way, I&#8217;m incredibly jealous of your domain name. That&#8217;s just a stroke of luck that there&#8217;s a whole top level domain with your final two letters of your name in there. That&#8217;s lovely. I&#8217;ll add that into the show notes as well. But, Aaron Jorbin, thank you so much for chatting to me today. A real pleasure, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:14] <strong>Aaron Jorbin:</strong> Thank you so much for having me.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Aaron Jorbin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron has led teams responsible for some of the largest and most prominent WordPress sites in the world including Rolling Stone, Variety, WIRED, The New Yorker, and The White House. He is also a WordPress Core Committer who focuses on improving developer happiness and making the internet usable by everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s been an integral part of the WordPress community since 2010, and today Aaron opens up about the crucial importance of major and minor WordPress releases, and the need for user trust, which forms the backbone for features like auto updates that enhance WordPress security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the process behind WordPress releases, discussing how major and minor updates are planned and executed. Aaron explains the dynamics of the Core Committer community, a group of around 100 dedicated individuals, about 50 of whom are currently active, whose decisions and hard work keep WordPress robust, up to date and secure. The commitment to transparency, minimal egos, and the ability to handle criticism are mentioned as key elements for maintaining trust inside this community within a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about how communication and decision-making take place mostly in public forums, ensuring openness and collaboration. The conversation also touches on the ebb and flow of volunteer and sponsored contributors, the challenges of coordinating across global time zones, and the need for asynchronous decision making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron explains what it takes to move from a small contributor to a key player in the WordPress ecosystem, emphasising the burden of responsibility that comes with making changes affecting millions of non-technical users. Whether you&#8217;re a developer, tester, or enthusiastic user, Aaron encourages contributions in various forms, from sharing ideas to testing and providing feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered how WordPress is maintained and updated, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.condenast.com/\">Condé Nast</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/03/28/grunt-patch-wordpress-1-0-0/\">Grunt Patch WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/\">Previous WordPress releases</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/\">Drupal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/wordpressdc/\">WordPress DC meetup</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://xkcd.com/2347/\">Dependency cartoon from xkcd</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">WordPress Slack</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/playground/\">WordPress Playground</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in/\">Aaron&#8217;s website</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"Akismet: What is reCAPTCHA?

You probably get spam phone calls, spam texts, and spam emails. <em>You’ve won a prize. You’ve broken a copyright law. You’ve placed an order and need to verify your account details.</em> <em>You can make $3,956 a day working from home doing this one cool trick</em>. It sucks up our time and, if we fall for it, can be downright dangerous.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there’s also spam on many websites. Comment sections filled with links to less-than-reputable pages designed to phish for sensitive info or initiate a malware download.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For site owners, spammy comment sections, fake user registrations, and false contact form submissions can add hours of work each week, make your site seem less legitimate, and put visitors and your entire reputation at risk.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s where reCAPTCHA comes in. Owned by Google, reCAPTCHA is a free service that distinguishes real human users from automated bots. But there are pros and cons to implementing reCAPTCHA on your site, so you’ll need to weigh your options carefully in order to find an effective solution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>In this post, we’ll take a closer look at reCAPTCHA and how it works. Then, we’ll explore the main drawbacks of reCAPTCHA, and consider a better alternative. Let’s jump right&nbsp;in!</p>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-284031\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is&nbsp;reCAPTCHA?</h2>\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA is a free Google service that protects websites from spam. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-captcha/\">CAPTCHA tests</a> were first introduced in 1997 as an extra layer of security against hackers and bots.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tests were deployed primarily on login pages and <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-add-wordpress-contact-form/\">contact form pages</a>. They generated distorted text and users had to decipher the words to pass the test. Since then, CAPTCHAs have become more complex to keep up with evolving technologies and bots.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>The advanced nature of CAPTCHA can cause problems for the user experience (UX) since it demands more input from site visitors. In fact, reCAPTCHA (introduced in 2007) presents more complicated challenges like puzzles and image identification, which typically require user&nbsp;interaction.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"434\" height=\"627\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image.png\" alt=\"example of a CAPTCHA with images of cars\" class=\"wp-image-284033\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, reCAPTCHA was acquired by Google. The original version is no longer available since it was found to be too easy for bots (using algorithms trained in pattern recognition) and too difficult for humans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>So now, there are different versions of reCAPTCHA, which we’ll explore later in the&nbsp;post.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-does-recaptcha work\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does reCAPTCHA&nbsp;work?</h2>\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA uses artificial intelligence (AI) to differentiate between humans and bots. While the traditional CAPTCHA issued tests before allowing visitor access, algorithms trained in pattern recognition could quickly solve these challenges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, reCAPTCHA was introduced. As we discussed, the original version is no longer in use, but there are still two versions available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA v2 requires users to select images or check the “I’m not a robot”&nbsp;box.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"371\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1.png\" alt=\"example form with ReCAPTCHA\" class=\"wp-image-284034\" />\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, reCAPTCHA v3 aims to minimize the disruption to the user experience. Instead of requiring user interaction, it calculates scores based on user behavior. The website administrator can then allow or block access, but they can also issue further v2 tests, if needed, for&nbsp;verification.</p>\n\n<p>The latest version of reCAPTCHA (v3) uses a JavaScript API to determine a score between 0 and 1. While a score of 0 is judged to be a bot, a score of 1 is almost always a human user. It uses a concept called “actions” which lets you define steps in your typical user&nbsp;journey.</p>\n\n\n<p>This way, the reCAPTCHA technology learns how real users interact with your site so that it’s able to detect bot traffic. In fact, some websites deploy reCAPTCHA across all pages so that the technology has more user activity to work with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"distinction-between-captcha-and recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Distinction between CAPTCHA and&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</h2>\n\n<p>You might still be wondering about the <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/akismet-vs-captcha-vs-recaptcha/\">difference between CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA</a>. First off, CAPTCHA is an umbrella term used to describe any website authentication test to separate humans from&nbsp;bots.</p>\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, reCAPTCHA is a type of CAPTCHA test owned by Google. Note that there are several types of CAPTCHAs owned by different companies, and reCAPTCHA is just one of many.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>As we discussed, the original reCAPTCHA test was much more simplistic, primarily relying on word tests disguised with twisted letters. But now, there are different types of reCAPTCHA including images, checkboxes, and tests that require no user input at&nbsp;all.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-different-types-of recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The different types of&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</h2>\n\n<p>Now, let’s take a look at all <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/recaptcha-v2-vs-v3/\">the different versions of&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"recaptcha-v1\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA v1</h3>\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA v1 isn’t widely used anymore and was discontinued by Google in 2018. But this version of reCAPTCHA came the closest to emulating the traditional CAPTCHA tests that relied on object&nbsp;recognition.</p>\n\n\n<p>In this instance, a user would be presented with a pair of words, one of which functioned as a control word and could be understood by a bot. The other word could only be recognized by human users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>This CAPTCHA method was developed in the late 1990s and continued to be used throughout the 2010s. It also started using scanned words and photographs to make the tests more challenging, but it has since been replaced with more sophisticated reCAPTCHA&nbsp;tests.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"recaptcha-v2\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA v2</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After reCAPTCHA v1 was shut down, it was replaced with reCAPTCHA v2, which currently consists of three versions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one is the reCAPTCHA v2 for Android, which is an API that can protect Android apps from bot traffic. The API integrates directly into Android apps, and in an attempt to preserve the UX, the API allows low-risk users to pass through easily. When needed, the API will present a challenge to the user to verify that they are human.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s the reCAPTCHA v2 that most users are familiar with. This is the “I’m not a robot” checkbox. In this case, all that users have to do is check the box, rather than solve a complex test or problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>As such, it’s considered more user&#8209;friendly than previous methods. Though it sounds simple, Google analyzes various factors like mouse movement and browsing history to detect bot&nbsp;activity.</p>\n\n\n<p>Even more sophisticated is the invisible reCAPTCHA badge which requires no user input at all. Similar to the previous method, Google evaluates activities like mouse movement and typing patterns. This version of reCAPTCHA is triggered via a JavaScript API call or when a user clicks on a button.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s still not a perfect solution since sophisticated bots that use AI technology can bypass the reCAPTCHA. And, it isn’t immune to CAPTCHA farms — which are businesses that employ human workers to solve reCAPTCHAs to aid cybercriminals and hackers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"recaptcha-v3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA v3</h3>\n\n\n<p>In further attempts to improve the UX, Google introduced reCAPTCHA v3, which works similarly to the invisible reCAPTCHA badge. This version of reCAPTCHA works in the background, so it’s completely invisible to users and presents no&nbsp;tests.</p>\n\n<p>The reCAPTCHA v3 method tracks all requests made by a user on a website, and every request is given a score between 0 and 1. As we discussed earlier, a score close to 0 is likely to be a bot whereas a score closer to 1 is judged as&nbsp;human.</p>\n\n\n<p>The interactions monitored by the reCAPTCHA vary between websites. For instance, the administrator can provide examples of normal user interactions&nbsp;so that the reCAPTCHA can pick up on any deviation from the norm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA v3 is the best version of the technology in terms of efficacy and UX. That said, it’s more difficult to implement since the scores must be defined by the administrator, which can be time&#8209;consuming to set&nbsp;up.</p>\n\n\n<p>With this in mind, you might automatically block users who return a score below 0.2. Then, scores between 0.2 and 0.6 may generate a CAPTCHA challenge to verify that the user is human.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, any score above 0.6 may instantly be granted access. The issue is that a strict scoring system holds the potential to block out legitimate users while a lenient system may allow bots to bypass the reCAPTCHA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"challenges-and-downsides-of recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenges and downsides of&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</h2>\n\n\n<p>Now that you know the different types of reCAPTCHA, let’s take a look at the main limitations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-impact-on-users-with disabilities\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Impact on users with&nbsp;disabilities</h3>\n\n\n<p>It’s imperative to design web content in a way that’s accessible to people with disabilities. This way, your enterprise site can comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>The problem is that many reCAPTCHA tests are visual and require users to identify images or text. This has been shown to <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3524010.3539498\">discriminate against users with visual impairments</a>. And since they’re designed to be unreadable by machines, screen readers are unable to interpret&nbsp;them.</p>\n\n\n<p>Additionally, audio reCAPTCHA tests alienate users with hearing impairments. Meanwhile, the mathematical equation tests are believed to be more accessible to users with vision impairments, but these can exclude those with cognitive disorders like dyscalculia.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-annoyance-and frustration\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Annoyance and&nbsp;frustration</h3>\n\n<p>Many users may find reCAPTCHA annoying. When you expect instant access to a page, and instead you’re required to check a box or complete a task, it’s natural to become&nbsp;frustrated.</p>\n\n<p>This can lead to early exits. High bounce rates can send signals to search engines that users don’t find your website valuable. Therefore, it can result in both traffic and revenue&nbsp;loss.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"3-data-collection-and-privacy concerns\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Data collection and privacy&nbsp;concerns</h3>\n\n<p>In order to differentiate between bots and humans, reCAPTCHA v3 and the invisible reCAPTCHA badge analyze data like mouse navigation and click patterns. Since this is classified as personal data, this method of reCAPTCHA requires privacy&nbsp;compliance.</p>\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of laws and legislations that exist to protect user privacy on the internet. Most notable, perhaps, is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, but there’s also the Colorado Privacy Act, the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and many more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Therefore, it’s important to gather consent from users if you plan to implement reCAPTCHA. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/assistant/console/policies/privacy-policy-guide\">Google recommends a privacy policy</a> that informs users of the data collected, the data shared, and a statement that tells users how the data will be&nbsp;used.</p>\n\n\n<p>That said, this is considered the bare minimum in terms of privacy, so it’s useful to have a proper look into what should be included. This is very important since non-compliance can damage your reputation, erode customer trust, and lead to heavy financial penalties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-recaptchaâs-decreasing effectiveness\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. reCAPTCHA’s decreasing&nbsp;effectiveness</h3>\n\n\n<p>Another potential problem with reCAPTCHA is its effectiveness given the emergence of artificial intelligence. In fact, researchers from the University of Columbia <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7467367\">created reCAPTCHA attacks</a> that managed to solve 70 percent of all challenges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>This shows that reCAPTCHA is no longer as effective as it once was, whether that’s down to AI, CAPTCHA farms, or internal logic. What’s more, reCAPTCHA v3 requires the analysis of user&nbsp;behavior.</p>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA needs a large volume of data to determine normal human interactions and tell them apart from bots. But this technology relies on a client&#8209;side fingerprinting approach, which advanced bots can bypass&nbsp;easily.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5-potential-for-false positives\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Potential for false&nbsp;positives</h3>\n\n\n<p>The final drawback to reCAPTCHA is that there is still the potential for false positives, which can block legitimate users from your site. For instance, enterprises that prioritize security may adopt a strict scoring system for reCAPTCHA v3. This makes it harder for users to score 1.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give you an example, many administrators grant low scores to users who submit forms very quickly. That said, some human users are naturally quick typers, but going by this system, they may be flagged and denied access to your website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, researchers from the University of Toronto found that <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.01003\">reCAPTCHA gives lower scores</a> to users who don’t have a Google account. Therefore, privacy-conscious visitors who use private browsers or VPNs are more likely to be mistaken for bots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"akismet-the-better-alternative-to recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: The better alternative to&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</h2>\n\n<p>Considering the challenges and drawbacks of reCAPTCHA, you may be cautious about deploying it on your website. Instead, you might prefer an alternative anti&#8209;spam solution that is more inclusive and doesn’t disrupt the&nbsp;UX.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a> was developed by Automattic (the same team behind WordPress.com) and it’s one of the <a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">leading anti&#8209;spam plugins</a>. It protects you against form, comment, and text&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"732\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2.png\" alt=\"Akismet homepage with the text \" />\n\n\n<p>Since 2005, Akismet has removed over 500 billion pieces of spam across 100 million sites. The plugin is powered by machine learning, which explains how Akismet detects spam with a 99.99 percent accuracy&nbsp;rating.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike reCAPTCHA, Akismet doesn’t require too much from your visitors. Instead, it operates behind the scenes, so it doesn’t add friction to your UX. This means that users may be more likely to stay on your website, helping you <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/form-conversion-rate/\">get more conversions</a> and&nbsp;sales.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-akismet works\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Akismet&nbsp;works</h2>\n\n<p>Akismet analyzes every piece of user&#8209;submitted content to prevent a range of online attacks. This analysis takes place in real time, so you can block suspicious activity before it even reaches your&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n<p>It’s best to think of Akismet as a filter, where legitimate submissions are allowed to pass through, but spam submissions are denied. This saves you from manually reviewing every&nbsp;submission.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned earlier, Akismet is powered by machine learning algorithms. This enables the plugin to compare the content of submissions against a database of known spam. Plus, it integrates with popular form plugins, so you’re not limited to <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/comment-spam/\">blog comment&nbsp;spam</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p>You’ll also get access to monthly and annual spam charts. This way, you can check your spam accuracy rating, false positives, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>The Akismet plugin is simple to install on WordPress, but you will need an API key to connect to the Akismet&nbsp;database.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-akismet-over recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Benefits of Akismet over&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</h2>\n\n\n<p>Now that you know more about Akismet, let’s look at the benefits of using this plugin over reCAPTCHA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-improved accessibility\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Improved&nbsp;accessibility</h3>\n\n<p>As we discussed earlier, one of the limitations of reCAPTCHA is that some versions require users to decipher visual or auditory information. Other versions contain mathematical equations or ask users to complete&nbsp;checkboxes.</p>\n\n\n<p>This can exclude those with cognitive, hearing, or visual impairments. Therefore, if you want to keep an accessible website, you’re better off <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/captcha-alternatives/\">using a CAPTCHA alternative</a> like Akismet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet doesn’t require any user interaction. It works silently behind the scenes, so users can submit content without running into any obstacles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-enhanced-user experience\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Enhanced user&nbsp;experience</h3>\n\n\n<p>All kinds of reCAPTCHA (except v3) add friction to the user experience, as they require individuals to check a box or complete a test. This delays access to a page or resource, which can lead to frustration on the user’s part.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Akismet doesn’t interfere with the UX. It operates in the background, so most users aren’t even aware of it. Additionally, the spam data is stored in the cloud, so the plugin doesn’t impact site&nbsp;speed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"3-privacy protection\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Privacy&nbsp;protection</h3>\n\n\n<p>While reCAPTCHA can reduce spam submissions, it does so by gathering personal data, which means you have to obtain explicit consent from users. Plus, privacy-conscious users may be perturbed by data collection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Akismet also collects personal data, but only that which is needed to carry out spam protection. According to the GDPR, this is classified as a “legitimate interest” use of that data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the plugin settings, you can easily enable a privacy notice that informs users about this. The company never sells personal data gathered through the plugin. You can check out the <a href=\"https://automattic.com/privacy/\">full privacy policy here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-better-spam detection\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Better spam&nbsp;detection</h3>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA is primarily an anti&#8209;spam measure, but the <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/do-captcha-and-recaptcha-protect-wordpress-sites-from-bots/\">effectiveness of reCAPTCHA</a> has been challenged by advances in AI technology and the growth of CAPTCHA&nbsp;farms.</p>\n\n<p>Akismet has a long reputation for detecting spam with very high accuracy. Currently, the plugin boasts an overall accuracy score of 99.99 percent, but you can view the exact spam accuracy score within your Akismet&nbsp;dashboard.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5-reduced-false positives\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Reduced false&nbsp;positives</h3>\n\n<p>Earlier, we mentioned the fact that some versions of reCAPTCHA frequently result in false positives which block legitimate users from websites. This is especially true in the case of reCAPTCHA v3 (where administrators have to define their own rules) and for users who opt for private browsers and VPNs. Not only is this frustrating for users, but it can also result in revenue loss for&nbsp;organizations.</p>\n\n\n<p>With Akismet, submissions are analyzed in real time and with incredible accuracy. Additionally, there are systems in place that make it easy for websites to <a href=\"https://akismet.com/support/general/akismet-unblocking-a-spam/\">report false positives</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to forms, you can simply remove submissions from the spam list. For comments, all you have to do is check the relevant boxes and use the <strong>Bulk actions </strong>dropdown menu to select <strong>Not spam.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked questions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently asked&nbsp;questions</h2>\n\n<p>This guide has answered questions like “what is reCAPTCHA” and “how does reCAPTCHA work”, but you may still be looking for clarification on this technology. We’ll answer some other common questions in the next&nbsp;section.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-primary-purpose-of recaptcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the primary purpose of&nbsp;reCAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n\n<p>The primary purpose of reCAPTCHA is to differentiate human users from bots in order to block spam and other forms of online abuse. It is a type of technology that deploys adaptive challenges like image identification and checkboxes that detect suspicious behavior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-does-recaptcha-differentiate-between-a-human-and-a bot\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does reCAPTCHA differentiate between a human and a&nbsp;bot?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Depending on the version of reCAPTCHA, different factors are considered to distinguish between bots and humans. For example, some reCAPTCHA tests track cursor movement, typing patterns, and browser history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA v3 evaluates these factors to generate scores. Scores closer to 0 are judged to be bots while those closer to 1 are considered human.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-key-differences-between-recaptcha-v2-and v3\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the key differences between reCAPTCHA v2 and&nbsp;v3?</h3>\n\n\n<p>There are some key differences between reCAPTCHA v2 and v3. reCAPTCHA v2 includes three different methods including the Android API, the “I’m not a robot” checkbox, and the invisible reCAPTCHA badge. All of these, except the badge, require user interaction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA v3 doesn’t require user input. Instead, it monitors certain factors like mouse movement and typing patterns to return a score between 0 and 1, which helps systems detect bot traffic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"is-recaptcha-completely-effective-against-bots-and-automated attacks\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is reCAPTCHA completely effective against bots and automated&nbsp;attacks?</h3>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA is an <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/best-anti-spam-wordpress-plugins-compared/\">anti&#8209;spam service</a> that attempts to block bots and prevent automated attacks like distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. The problem is that several researchers have questioned the effectiveness of reCAPTCHA. For instance, researchers from the University of Columbia launched low&#8209;risk bot attacks that solved over 70 percent of all&nbsp;challenges.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-does-recaptcha-impact-the-overall-user-experience-on websites\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does reCAPTCHA impact the overall user experience on&nbsp;websites?</h3>\n\n<p>Most versions of reCAPTCHA require users to solve mathematical problems, decipher images and text, or simply check a box. While this may not sound too problematic, it adds friction to the user&nbsp;experience.</p>\n\n\n<p>It delays users from accessing the desired page or resource, which can be frustrating. In turn, this can lead to early exits — which affect bounce rates, traffic volume, revenue, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"can-recaptcha-be-bypassed-or-tricked-by-sophisticated bots\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can reCAPTCHA be bypassed or tricked by sophisticated&nbsp;bots?</h3>\n\n\n<p>There are ways for cybercriminals and bots to bypass reCAPTCHA tests. To do this, all they have to do is raise the trust score by mimicking normal human behavior on a web browser.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can achieve this effect by using a resistant TLS fingerprint. Plus, hackers can execute JavaScript using browser automation tools, and rotate JavaScript fingerprint details.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-implications-of-recaptcha-for-user privacy\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the implications of reCAPTCHA for user&nbsp;privacy?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Since reCAPTCHA gathers personal data about the user’s browser and device, certain states and countries require companies to get user consent. In particular, the GDPR ensures that visitors know how websites use, process, and store their information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, you’ll need to obtain explicit consent. It’s also important to display a privacy policy on your site. Otherwise, you may encounter hefty financial penalties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"are-there-any-alternatives-to-recaptcha-that-offer-similar-or-better functionalities\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there any alternatives to reCAPTCHA that offer similar or better&nbsp;functionalities?</h3>\n\n<p>Although reCAPTCHA is capable of blocking some spam, it can interfere with the UX and discriminate against those with disabilities. Therefore, you might prefer a more user&#8209;friendly alternative, like&nbsp;Akismet.</p>\n\n\n<p>Akismet works in the background of your site, so it requires no user interaction. It also filters spam with an impressive accuracy rating of 99.99 percent, which means it rarely produces false positives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-accurate-is-akismet-at-stopping spam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How accurate is Akismet at stopping&nbsp;spam?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet filters comment, form, and text spam with a 99.99 percent accuracy rate. Plus, it analyzes submissions in real time to maximize threat protection. And there are systems in place to report false positives, which makes Akismet much more effective than&nbsp;reCAPTCHA.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-many-sites-use akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How many sites use&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet is installed on over 100 million websites, and the plugin has blocked over 500 billion spam submissions. Better yet, it’s trusted by plenty of enterprise brands like Microsoft, ConvertKit, Bluehost, and&nbsp;WordPress.com.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"are-there-any-case-studies-of-companies-that-use akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there any case studies of companies that use&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n<p>If you want to know how Akismet has helped real brands, you can check out some case studies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/convertkit-customerstory/\">ConvertKit</a> implemented Akismet to filter out spam and automate spam prevention. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/saying-no-to-spam-on-smitten-kitchens-popular-food-site/\">Smitten Kitchen</a> automated spam detection in the comments section of recipes, which has helped prevent the presence of affiliate links and irrelevant promotions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"where-can-i-learn-more-about akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where can I learn more about&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about the service, you can find a lot of <a href=\"https://akismet.com/resources/\">free resources</a>. Akismet also has a <a href=\"https://akismet.com/support/\">dedicated support page</a> to help you set up and use the plugin. And the <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/\">Akismet blog</a> is frequently updated with useful articles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"akismet-the-best-spam-solution-for-your website\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: The best spam solution for your&nbsp;website</h2>\n\n<p>Spam is a concern for any site administrator, since it can make your site appear less trustworthy and lead to cyberattacks. While reCAPTCHA is one solution for preventing spam, it may not be the best option in terms of user&nbsp;experience.</p>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA v3 runs in the background of your site, but it can still be frustrating for visitors. Additionally, it can exclude those with disabilities and incorrectly block legitimate visitors. Therefore, you might prefer a better alternative, like&nbsp;Akismet.</p>\n\n<p>With a 99.99 percent accuracy rating, Akismet is excellent at blocking comment, form, and text spam. It also analyzes submissions in real time, and it doesn’t interfere with the UX. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">Get started with the Akismet&nbsp;today</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Jul 2024 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Jen Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"Do The Woo Community: Recap of Do the Woo 4.0 Launch and WordPress dot com Post\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=84450\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://dothewoo.io/recap-of-do-the-woo-4-0-launch-and-wordpress-dot-com-post/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1839:\"<p>As you know, during the week of WordCamp Europe 2024 last month, June 10 &#8211; 15, we led up to our huge launch of 4.0 at the event.

I loved drawing with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint\">MacPaint</a> and found it much cooler than my <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch\">Etch A Sketch</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, my parents got a Windows 95 computer and we were connected to the internet. My parents would check for important calls before unhooking the telephone to plug in the computer. When Google search came out, my family would sit around the screen, amazed at the “dozens” of search results. We even played a game to see whose name got the most results. I won by a long shot because my middle name Luke (Japanese: ルカ) appears in the word “digital camera” (デジタルカメラ).</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>In junior high, I joined the table tennis club but quickly realized sports weren’t my thing. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I switched to the computer club, where I edited my first video, learned about spreadsheets and word processors, and built my first website using a Japanese software called Homepage Builder. I started maintaining a website for my church, self-teaching myself about staging environments and FTP through help docs and online manuals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In senior high, I started looking at the HTML code produced by Homepage Builder. I realized I didn’t have to use the drag-and-drop editor to make edits and taught myself basic HTML and CSS. That’s when I created my first game, an HTML game where players clicked on doors to navigate a maze. I remember someone “hacked” my game by figuring out the URL logic and jumping to the goal. That was my introduction to cyber security and encryption.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-information-ethics-opened-my-eyes-to-the-diversity-in-the-world\">How information ethics opened my eyes to the diversity in the world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In university, I studied information science, which pulled me deeper into the tech world. I continued to master’s and doctorate programs, and started teaching tech classes at three universities. I taught in both Japanese and English to both undergraduate and postgraduate students. Subjects included programming basics (C, Java), informatics, and image processing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my most favorite subject was information ethics, which highlighted how different cultures have varying ethical values in tech. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>For instance, some communities pirate software out of necessity, some share login credentials to bypass censorship, while other communities consider both these practices unethical. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Teaching this course really opened my eyes to global diversity. It taught me the importance of open dialogue, empathetic listening, and creative thinking.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-i-met-wordpress\">How I met WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I first heard about WordPress in my university lab. A senior student returning from overseas said it was all the hype in the west, so we moved our lab’s website to WordPress. I didn’t fully understand what WordPress was then, but I decided to ride the hype and move my church websites to WordPress too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since making the switch in 2014, WordPress has become my Content Management System (CMS) of choice. I tried a brief stint with Wix, but it just confirmed my loyalty to WordPress. And after joining Automattic, I discovered the community behind the software and my love for WordPress has grown even more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-i-joined-automattic-and-the-wordpress-community\">How I joined Automattic and the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At one point, I installed the VideoPress plugin on one of my sites and needed support with a subscription mix-up. The agent resolved my issue in one email and signed off as a “Happiness Engineer,” which made me smile. Years later, I saw a job opening for Happiness Engineers at <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> and remembered that interaction. I volunteered on the WordPress.com support forums for a couple months building up my support skills before getting accepted into Automattic in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon after joining, I learned that WordPress is more than just a CMS. It’s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">a community</a> built on open-source principles. I didn’t wait long to attend my local WordPress Meetups later that year, and was amazed at the selflessness and dedication of the participants. At those Meetups, I learned the WordPress ecosystem extends beyond the community that creates it. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>WordPress is composed of the people who use it &#8211; the developers, designers, analysts, hobbyists, hosts, marketers, etc. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a common bond that brings people together from different walks of life to a safe space of diversity and acceptance. It was the first time I had interacted with people quite like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-my-journey-in-the-wordpress-training-team\">My journey in the WordPress Training Team</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, the pandemic canceled in-person events, but I had opportunities to be part of educational projects within Automattic. I coached Japanese support agents, created internal training materials, and developed a new onboarding program for new employees. These experiences rekindled my love for education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was around that time that WordPress launched its educational site, <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a>. I was selected for an internal position at Automattic to become a full time contributor to the Learn WordPress initiative, and joined the WordPress project’s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">Training Team</a> in June 2022. I started in the team by understanding the team’s values, priorities, and challenges. Over the next six months, I worked on improving team processes and documentation. At the end of 2022, I was honored to be nominated as a team rep, since which I’ve led projects like migrating from Trello to GitHub and building an onboarding program. These efforts have increased team member engagement and activity, which in turn is contributing to traffic and engagement increases on the Learn WordPress site, too.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id7139_e29120-08 alignfull has-theme-palette1-background-color kt-row-has-bg wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-3-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top kb-theme-content-width\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column7139_ab010b-f3\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ben-wordcamp-asia-2023.jpg\" class=\"kb-advanced-image-link\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ben-wordcamp-asia-2023-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Evans at WordCamp Asia 2023\" class=\"kb-img wp-image-7148\" /></a>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column7139_f7f196-5a\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ben-at-wordcamp-tokyo-2023.jpg\" class=\"kb-advanced-image-link\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"579\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ben-at-wordcamp-tokyo-2023-1024x579.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Evans at WordCamp Tokyo 2023\" class=\"kb-img wp-image-7149\" /></a>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column7139_fcf7c6-6d\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ben-wrodcamp-europe-2024-scaled.jpg\" class=\"kb-advanced-image-link\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ben-wrodcamp-europe-2024-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Evans at WordCamp Europe 2024\" class=\"kb-img wp-image-7150\" /></a>\n</div></div>\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpress-a-safe-space-to-be-authentic\">WordPress &#8211; a safe space to be authentic</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reflecting on my tech journey, the moments I felt most energized were when I contributed to creating a safe space of diversity and acceptance. Teaching information ethics laid the foundation, customer support as a Happiness Engineer let me practice this in 1:1 interactions, onboarding new employees allowed me to create these spaces for larger groups, and contributing to the WordPress Training Team extended this to a global community. These were moments when I felt most authentic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a safe space where one can be authentic isn’t a one-time project; it’s formed through humble and curious interactions. Every conversation can either build or destroy safety. I remember the excitement of my first WordPress Meetup, where I felt accepted for who I am. My hope is that everyone who interacts with the WordPress community experiences that same acceptance. I look forward to continuing contributing to this safe space &#8211; WordPress &#8211; so that both I and those around me can continue to be our authentic selves.</p>\n\n\n<div

技術との触れ合い</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>私が初めて IT 技術と触れ合ったのは、小学校に入学したころ、親のマッキントッシュ・コンピューターを通してでした。<a href=\"https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint\">MacPaint</a> でのお絵描きが大好きで、それまで遊んでいた <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch\">Etch A Sketch</a> よりもはるかにかっこいいと感じました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>その後、親が Windows 95 コンピューターを購入し、インターネットに接続しました。両親は重要な電話がくる予定がないかを確認してから電話線を外し、コンピューターを接続していました。Google 検索が登場したとき、家族で画面の周りに集まり、「数十件」もの検索結果に驚いていました。私たちは、誰の名前が最も多くの検索結果を引き出すかを競うゲームもしました。私のミドルネーム「ルカ」が「デジタルカメラ」に含まれているため、私が圧倒的に勝ちました。</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>中学では卓球部に入りましたが、スポーツが自分に合わないとすぐに気付きました。</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>そこでコンピュータークラブに転部し、初めてのビデオ編集、スプレッドシートやワードプロセッサの学習、そしてホームページビルダーという日本のソフトウェアを使った初めてのウェブサイト作成を経験しました。その頃から教会のウェブサイトの管理を始め、ステージング環境や FTP についてヘルプドキュメントやオンラインマニュアルを読みながら独学で学びました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>高校では、ホームページビルダーが生成する HTML コードを見始め、ドラッグ＆ドロップエディタを使わずにサイトを編集できることに気付き、基本的な HTML と CSS も独学で習得しました。初めてのゲームを作成したのもその頃です。プレイヤーがドアをクリックして迷路を進む HTML ゲームでしたが、誰かが URL の論理を解読し、ゴールにいきなり飛ぶ「ハック」をしたことを覚えています。これが私のサイバーセキュリティと暗号化の世界への初めての導入でした。</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-情報倫理を通して多様性に目が開かれる\"><strong>情報倫理を通して多様性に目が開かれる</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>大学では情報科学を学び、IT 技術の世界にさらに深く入り込みました。修士課程と博士課程に進み、三つの大学で情報系の授業を教え始めました。日本語と英語の両方で、学部生と大学院生にプログラミングの基本（C、Java）、情報学、画像処理などを教えました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>しかし、最も好きだった科目は情報倫理でした。これは、様々な文化が IT 技術に対して異なる倫理的価値観を持っていることを強調するものでした。</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>例えば、あるコミュニティは必要に迫られてソフトウェアを海賊版で使用し、あるコミュニティは検閲を回避するためにログイン情報を共有し、他のコミュニティはこれらの行為を非倫理的と見なします。</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>この科目を教えることで、世界の多様性に目が開かれました。オープンな対話、共感的な聞き方、そして創造的な思考の重要性を強く感じました。</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpressとの出会い\"><strong>WordPressとの出会い</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>大学の研究室で初めて WordPress について聞きました。海外から帰国した先輩が、西洋ではこれが大人気だと言って、研究室の Web サイトを WordPress に移行しました。その時は WordPress が何であるか完全には理解していませんでしたが、流行に乗って自分が管理していた教会のウェブサイトも WordPress に移行しました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2014年に移行して以来、私がサイトを作るときのコンテンツ管理システム（CMS）の選択肢は WordPress 一択になりました。Wix を試したこともありましたが、WordPress への忠誠を再確認するだけでした。その後 Automattic に入社し、ソフトウェアの背後にあるコミュニティを発見した時には、WordPress への愛がさらに深まりました。</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-automattic-と-wordpress-コミュニティへの参加\"><strong>Automattic と WordPress コミュニティへの参加</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>ある時、私のサイトに VideoPress プラグインをインストールした際、サブスクリプションの問題でサポートが必要でした。担当者はただ一通のメールで問題を解決し、署名には「ハピネス・エンジニア」と書いていました。それを読んだ時、私は笑顔になりました。数年後<a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">、Automattic</a> でハピネス・エンジニアの求人を見かけ、当時のやり取りを思い出しました。私は WordPress.com のサポートフォーラムで数ヶ月ボランティアをしてサポートスキルを磨き、2019年に Automattic に入社しました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>入社して間もなく、WordPress は単なる CMS 以上のものであることを知りました。それはオープンソースの原則に基づく<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">コミュニティ</a>だったのです。その年の後半には地元の WordPress ミートアップに参加し、参加者の無私と献身に驚かされました。そのミートアップでは、WordPress がそれを作るコミュニティを超えて広がっていることを学びました。</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>WordPress は、使用する人々、すなわち開発者、デザイナー、解析者、趣味の人、ホスト、マーケティング担当者などで構成されていました。</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>それは異なる背景を持つ人々を、多様性と受容性を大切にする安全な場所に結びつける共通の絆です。そのような人々と初めて触れ合った瞬間でした。</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpress-トレーニングチームでの経験\"><strong>WordPress トレーニングチームでの経験</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>2020年、コロナ禍によって対面イベントが中止される中、Automattic 内で教育プロジェクトに参加する機会がありました。そこで日本のサポートチームを指導し、内部トレーニング資料を作成し、新入社員向けの新しい教育課程を開発しました。これらの経験は私の教育への想いを再燃させました。</p>\n\n\n\n<p>その頃、WordPress は教育サイト <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a> を立ち上げました。私は Automattic 内でフルタイムのコントリビューター（貢献者）として Learn WordPress プログラムに参加するために指名され、2022年6月に WordPress プロジェクトの<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">トレーニングチーム</a>に加わりました。最初はチームの価値観、優先事項、そして課題を理解することから始めました。次の6ヶ月間で、チームのプロセスとドキュメントを改善するために取り組みました。2022年の終わりにはチーム代表に推薦され、Trello から GitHub へのシステム移行やオンボーディングプログラムの構築などのプロジェクトをリードしました。これらの努力はチームメンバーのエンゲージメントと活動を増加させ、その結果、Learn WordPress サイトへのトラフィックとエンゲージメントの増加にも寄与しています。</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap

WordPress ミートアップで感じた、受け入れられる喜びを鮮明に覚えています。私の希望は、WordPress コミュニティと触れ合うすべての人が、その同じ受容性を経験することです。私も周囲の人々も本当の自分であり続けるために、WordPress というこの安全な場所に貢献し続けることを楽しみにしています。</p>\n<p>The post <a

Welcome to the next episode of All Things WordPress and WooCommerce in regards to accessibility. My name is Anne Bovelett. I&#8217;m an accessibility specialist. I have a lot to say about accessibility, and I try to teach anyone who wants to hear it and probably those who don&#8217;t want to hear it too. Accessibility is very important. Since we&#8217;re talking e-commerce, we&#8217;re also talking about revenue. It doesn&#8217;t really matter why you make something accessible, as long as you do it. If your web shop is losing revenue by the thousands or millions because you&#8217;re not making it accessible, you&#8217;d have good reason to do it, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that came out a bit harsh, but I don&#8217;t mean it that way. We&#8217;re trying to come from a kind place. One of the things we&#8217;ve learned lately is that people are saying, &#8220;We don&#8217;t know where to go. We don&#8217;t know who to turn to. We don&#8217;t know who to ask or who to trust.&#8221; I can understand that this is a very uneasy situation to be in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that if my co-host Taeke Reijenga could have been here today, he would have started filling us in on a lot of stuff in that regard. Unfortunately, due to personal circumstances, he couldn&#8217;t be here today, but he&#8217;ll probably be back next episode. So, let&#8217;s see how far we get today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This show is not just about the people that everybody already knows. We love the familiar faces, but it&#8217;s also about introducing some people you may not know yet. Today, I&#8217;m super excited to introduce Regine Gessner from the IAAP. I&#8217;ll ask her to explain what the IAAP is, who she is, what the IAAP is doing, and about an interesting discussion we had in December about certification. Hi Regine, welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />Hello Anne. Thank you very much for having me here today. I&#8217;m very happy to join in. My name is Regine Gessner, and I am working for the IAAP, which stands for the International Association of Accessibility Professionals, an association based in the U.S. The IAAP started 10 years ago and has developed several chapters in different regions. Four years ago, we started the German-speaking chapter, called IAAP DACH, which stands for Deutschland, Austria, and Switzerland. We are in charge of the German-speaking community and are the contact point for these countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IAAP&#8217;s mission is to network and exchange ideas. That&#8217;s one of our key pillars. Another is certification and advanced training. These are our key points. Since we started here in the German-speaking area, we have more than 350 members, including organizations. When you become a member, you are a member of the global IAAP, but then you will be directed to the region where you are based. Worldwide, IAAP has 6,500 members and about 220 organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s basically what the IAAP is. My position, since a bit more than a year ago, is to manage everything full-time, as it became too much to handle voluntarily. I am the main key contact for all people interested in membership and certifications. I&#8217;m the connection to the global team in the US and coordinate our working groups, board, and some of our tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Alright, so just for our audience, because we have mentioned certification several times, this is about the certification for specialists in accessibility in several disciplines. These certifications are sometimes a topic of discussion regarding their value and importance. We will get into that later on because this was the basis of our discussion in December.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons I asked you to join us today is because we know that in many organizations, regardless of size, it matters that you have people trained to maintain accessibility over time. Accessibility is not a one-off, is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />That&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s not a one-off; it&#8217;s an ongoing process. It&#8217;s not something that is done and then over. It&#8217;s something you have to start and build up capacity or competence in your company and teams. To implement it is not only technical but also a mindset in the people. That is very important and a key pillar. It must be obvious and natural that thinking about accessibility is part of the company or structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Let me ask you a controversial question. Do you think companies should make CPAC certification an obligatory certification for everybody working on their digital representation? Would that be a good idea?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />I would say yes. From my personal view, even as a newcomer in this topic, I did the CPAC certification, and it gave me a basic understanding of what we&#8217;re talking about. It covers disability models, types of disabilities, barriers people face in the digital world, what can help them, and what&#8217;s important to know when building a website, app, or documents. It&#8217;s not a technical certification but a basic knowledge one. So, I would recommend it as a good foundation when building your team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yeah. I&#8217;ve been thinking about this topic long and hard, especially now that we&#8217;re talking about it with this podcast. I hear a lot of companies say, &#8220;Making things accessible is too expensive.&#8221; But what if you integrate this into the core of your business? If it becomes second nature, getting the CPAC certification teaches you a lot about the why. And if you understand the why, it comes more naturally to a person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why I was asking this question. It&#8217;s tough because, in an ideal world, you&#8217;d want everyone certified. For example, if you own a web shop with a lot of people coding and creating content, you can say, &#8220;It&#8217;s expensive to remediate or keep fixing things.&#8221; But if you have to keep fixing things, it means people are doing things the wrong way. I would love to hear from our audience if they agree with this or why they disagree. Let&#8217;s discuss this in the next couple of weeks as people respond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing I wanted to ask you, the DACH chapter in Germany has about 350 members. While I&#8217;m happy there are so many members, I&#8217;m also worried because, with the upcoming legislation, it&#8217;s sad that the law has to push us to speed up a process we&#8217;ve been waiting for the past 20 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />Yes, I agree. In the beginning of 2023, we had about a hundred members, and now we&#8217;ve really increased. But for three countries, or even the whole world, having just 6,500 members in IAAP is not much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />But there is a great thing. It means there is opportunity for people working in web design, development, content creation, marketing, and communication to learn and expand their services. I&#8217;m sure many companies will want to do this and might outsource it. There are pros and cons to that, but let&#8217;s say our audience includes web shop owners, developers, designers, and other disciplines. If a web agency starts thinking about accessibility, learning about it, and expanding their services, what would you recommend from an IAAP point of view?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />If a company has no connection with accessibility yet, they can start by joining the community to network and learn. We offer several tools for our members to get in touch with each other, such as online breakfast meetings and networking events. These connections and exchanges are very valuable. Members can discuss their issues and concerns, and the group can help each other. This is very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />This is wonderful and very similar to the WordPress community, where we help each other succeed. It kept me coming back to WordPress in general. People exchange information and support each other. I hear complaints about Slack, and I’m one of them. Can you tell our listeners where they can go on your website to find out how to become a member and if they can talk to someone before becoming a member?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />It&#8217;s simple. They can email contact@iaap-dach.org, which is for the German-speaking region. This will come to me, and I can get in touch. I prefer personal calls to understand better. You don&#8217;t necessarily need to be a member to do certifications, but being a member has its benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Is the same approach available for the international department if people go to accessibilityassociation.org, or is this specific to the German chapter?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />We have several chapters, including a Nordic chapter for Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Iceland, a UK chapter, and a Mexican chapter. More chapters are in the process of starting. You are always welcome to contact the global colleagues from IAAP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />That&#8217;s wonderful because we have listeners from all over the world. Investing in accessibility can be costly for some, but it&#8217;s essential. Let&#8217;s discuss the December DACH region discussion about certification. People sometimes look for shortcuts to show certification without the proper intentions. There are also people with 10-20 years of experience who might question the need for certification. For example, someone who wrote the book on accessibility guidelines might be offered a junior salary because they lack certification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an interesting dialogue because certification is important. If someone gets certified, it means they learned a lot about the topic. There are several certifications, such as CPAC and WAS. Could you explain the prerequisites for the WAS certification?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />Yes, to start with the basic certification, CPAC, it gives you basic knowledge, but not expertise in digital accessibility. The WAS (Web Accessibility Specialist) certification requires a minimum of three years of documented roles and responsibilities in web accessibility. It’s not just enough to have knowledge of HTML or JavaScript; hands-on experience and knowledge of code elements and assistive technology are needed. This exam is for those with significant experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same applies to the ADS (Accessible Document Specialist) certification. These certifications are valid for three years and need to be renewed or maintained by collecting credential points through training or speaking at conferences. This ensures that knowledge stays current.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Accessibility is never a one-off, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />Exactly, it’s an ongoing process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />This brings up the importance of accredited courses, like those offered by the Accessibility Collective</p>\n\n\n\n<p>. They provide credits for IAAP certification, which helps ensure the courses give you long-term benefits. Companies need to understand where to find the correct information and how to avoid conflicting advice. Referring to the WCAG guidelines and talking to the IAAP are crucial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />I agree. The IAAP is not perfect, but we provide a platform, guidelines, and legislation. The discussion on certification is important, and there are many specialists with years of experience. They can use their references and tools to prove their expertise. The IAAP is one channel, but there are many pieces to the puzzle that help us on our way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yes, altogether we can take the fear out of doing accessibility right. Every time I speak to companies, I emphasize that accessibility is everyone’s task, not just one person&#8217;s. Support and teamwork are essential. If someone finds an issue, it’s about helping each other, not pointing fingers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone contacts you about an issue with your web shop, it’s a gift, even if it’s wrapped in anger. Engaging with them can turn them into ambassadors. Ignoring accessibility can mean losing potential customers, and it&#8217;s important to take these opportunities to improve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />Absolutely, everyone wants access to everything. For example, around 15% of people in Europe have some kind of disability and can&#8217;t use everything fully. This potential customer base is missed if your shop isn’t accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yes, there&#8217;s so much potential. Ignoring accessibility leaves about 13 trillion dollars on the table globally, which is larger than the Chinese economy. This includes all accessibility, not just digital. Restaurants not accessible to wheelchairs miss not just the person in the wheelchair, but also their friends and family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />Exactly, the whole group can&#8217;t go there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />So, if someone contacts you about an accessibility issue, consider it a valuable opportunity. Improving accessibility benefits everyone. Thank you so much, Regine, for coming on the show today at such short notice. Your insights were invaluable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regine:<br />Thank you very much for having me. It was a pleasure to be here, and I will make sure to provide all necessary links and information for your audience to learn more about us, our certifications, member benefits, and events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Thank you. And thank you to Greyd in Munich for sponsoring this podcast. This has been a different show than usual, but flexibility is important. We&#8217;ll talk about WordCamp Europe next month. Thank you, Bob Dunn, and Do the Woo for giving us this platform to discuss digital accessibility, especially in e-commerce. If you have questions or comments, please reach out to us. Thank you and see you next month.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong>All Things WordPress and WooCommerce via our series on accessibility</strong>, host <strong>Anne Bovelett </strong>is joined by <strong>Regine Gessner </strong>from the<strong> International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP)</strong>, as they explore the role of certifications in accessibility, the challenges companies face, and practical steps for integrating accessibility into digital projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also address common misconceptions and the need for ongoing education and community support to ensure web accessibility becomes second nature in digital development.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Highlights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Introduction to Accessibility</strong>: Anne Bovelett emphasizes the importance of accessibility in e-commerce and its impact on revenue, stating that accessibility should be integral to digital projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>R<strong>ole of IAAP</strong>: Regine Gessner introduces the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP) and its mission to network, exchange ideas, offer certifications, and provide advanced training in accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Certification Importance</strong>: The discussion focuses on the value of certifications like CPAC and WAS in establishing credibility and knowledge in accessibility.

Welcome to another BizChat here on Do the Woo. My name is Marcus Burnett and I&#8217;m a community marketer with GoDaddy. I am here today with my wonderful co-host from Barn2 plugins, Katie. Keith, how are you today, Katie?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Hey, great, thanks. What about you, Marcus?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, not doing too bad. We&#8217;re spanning all parts of the globe today, so it&#8217;s morning for me, afternoon for you, and evening for our guest, but doing pretty good. As usual, we have an excellent guest, and like I said, today we&#8217;re spanning all different parts of the globe. Joining us today from the ecommerce Marketing suite of tools at Metorik is founder Bryce Adams. Welcome to the show, Bryce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Thanks, Marcus. Thanks, Katie. Thanks for having me. Yeah, it&#8217;s really cool to be back on a Do the Woo show. I think the last time I did was maybe half a decade ago. I don&#8217;t know. I love being able to say half a decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />But yeah, it&#8217;s cool to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Happy to have you here. Bryce is here to talk about a report he recently published on the State of WooCommerce at Scale. But first, would you please share with folks a little bit about yourself and your company, Metorik?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Sure, yeah. So my name is Bryce and my background in Woo, I guess, started at WooCommerce itself back in 2014. I was there initially in a support role and eventually in a development role. Then Automattic acquired Woo in 2015. So I joined that and that happened pretty quickly, and then left in 2016 to do Metorik. So that&#8217;s like eight years ago now. I guess the majority of my career has been spent on it. Metorik is basically an analytics and email automation tool for WooCommerce and for Shopify and maybe more platforms in the future. But primarily we started with WooCommerce back in 2015 and only really added Shopify a few years ago. The majority of the customers we have around the world are WooCommerce stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />So let&#8217;s move on to the report then. You&#8217;ve recently published an insights report based on the sites which are using Metorik with WooCommerce. Can you tell us a bit about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Yeah, for sure. It was something we wanted to do for a really long time. I think even a few years in, as it was starting to approach several thousand stores, I was starting to see trends and patterns. One of the most common feature requests we got was benchmarking and trying to understand how a store compared to other stores, especially in Woo, where it can sometimes feel like we&#8217;re all kind of isolated on our own server and our own websites, not necessarily all on one platform. There was a lot of demand for clarity into what was going on. So people were asking for it a while ago, but a project like this is challenging to do well and at the quality level that I wanted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We couldn&#8217;t do it with the few of us that were working together, but the team&#8217;s growing recently and we&#8217;ve got more resources. Luke, someone who just joined primarily for marketing and design-related stuff, said, &#8220;Oh, I reckon I could throw something together if you can get the data.&#8221; We were just sitting around the couch here in Melbourne, brainstorming ideas. It&#8217;d be cool to see that stat and then on Twitter, I think Katie, we talked about some stats even a couple of months ago, about bundles. I was also talking with Vova from Freemius about different subscription stats. We started to create this foundation to do this at scale, thinking about privacy at the forefront of that. So anonymized samples of all that data and just using averages to try to paint a picture of what was going on. Once we had that list to work from, it started to be pretty fun. We were just going through a list like, okay, let&#8217;s try and figure out that metric and that one, and then you&#8217;ve got to actually dig through it a lot more to find the interesting parts. But it was a big project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I think it&#8217;s really useful for companies like yourself that have access to data of multiple sites to publish that because, as you said a minute ago, WooCommerce sites are all installed on people&#8217;s own servers unless you&#8217;re using Woo Express or something and people just don&#8217;t have those benchmarks. I&#8217;ve seen a bit of that going on in the industry. For example, WP Fusion&#8217;s year in review reports are really useful from a WordPress perspective because they publish data about the different sites running WP Fusion, which LMS plugins are the most popular and page builders and so on. So it was really nice to see a WooCommerce version of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />I think the fun thing for me was this was, I mean, I love Woo. It&#8217;s where I first started working, my first job really was at Woo, and then it&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve really ever known. I love it as a platform. I love what it enables, the fact that people can run their own site, control everything, customize everything, but also own everything. That idea of data ownership is so important to me. Woo enables that. Part of doing the report was wanting to validate, even though all these sites are their little islands out there on the internet, the scale that Woo is operating at is massive. I don&#8217;t think people realize it. We hear numbers being thrown around, several million Woo stores and things like that, but they don&#8217;t really mean anything until you actually see the data behind it and the scale and that validation, the brands that are using it. I don&#8217;t think people know how many Woo stores out there are doing millions of dollars a year in revenue. There&#8217;s tens of thousands, but yeah, I&#8217;m not sure the exact number, but there are so many stores out there that are really pushing the limits of Woo and people don&#8217;t know about it. So it&#8217;s cool to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />You said that Luke came in and kind of threw something together, but this is actually really polished and really nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Luke is so talented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Before we get into some of the different pieces of it, I do want to let people know that they can also follow along with us at metorik.com/woocommerce-insights. We&#8217;ll leave that link in the show notes, but if people want to look at it while we&#8217;re having a discussion here, that&#8217;s metorik.com/woocommerce-insights. I ended up writing just a ton of questions basically on every slide, so I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll get to all of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />That&#8217;s awesome. No, whatever is interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />I kind of want to jump in, maybe start from the top and work our way down. One of the first things that you shared in here is that the average age of WooCommerce stores is four years. That kind of lines up with the start of COVID in my head. How do you think COVID changed the landscape of ecommerce or specifically, WooCommerce?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />What we saw when COVID happened? Yeah, it&#8217;s an interesting perspective when you are coming at it as a SaaS because maybe as a plugin maker, Katie, you would&#8217;ve seen at the time an increase in sales as more people were setting up Woo stores. But for us, it wasn&#8217;t just an influx of more stores, but what was really interesting was what every store was doing across the line, the scale of the growth during that time. We have some reports we were looking at back then just in terms of being able to run the app and see the scale of order volume and Airbnb and things like that across everyone. It&#8217;s like a spike around COVID and just consistently through that whole period, we found that on average every store was doing better. There were definitely a lot of new stores starting, but I found it more interesting to see the existing stores all grow as a result of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, that all dropped off, and you can actually, it&#8217;s pretty interesting when you look at the higher scale, a five-year period, you see that growth and that decline happen through the actual order volume that&#8217;s happening. But in terms of the age, a lot of it comes down to the fact that Woo itself is not that old. The oldest a store could possibly be is probably 10 years, I&#8217;m not sure the exact age. Over time, very few stores are going to go from 11 years and still be running after all that time or necessarily be on the same platform. I think four years is actually probably bigger than what I&#8217;d expect just because Woo is such a young platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />That makes sense. A slightly more practical question, I was interested to see that you said 32% of stores are tracking their costs and profit as well as their sales. I was interested because I didn&#8217;t know it was possible to do via a website analytics tool. Everybody knows you&#8217;d use it to get sales data and things like that, which is a lot better than the sales data you get from WooCommerce reports in core, which is very basic obviously. But how does that work, tracking costs and profit, because that data isn&#8217;t entered into the WooCommerce admin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />I think that&#8217;s actually something that I&#8217;d love to see WooCommerce core improve, having the ability to set up a product cost. It should just be built into Woo by default. Shopify has it by default, almost Square does, almost every other ecommerce or commerce platform does because it is something that if you look at like 80/20, 80% plus of stores probably do have a cost that they want to set on a product. It should be core. It&#8217;s not, but we decided to offer that as a feature. Before that though, we just integrated directly with the WooCommerce Cost of Goods plugin, which itself Skyverge made, and that&#8217;s probably explained why it was so good and it worked really well because for us, we were able to then basically build this whole profit</p>\n\n\n\n<p>reporting feature and have all historical costs come in and profit reports come in without stores having to do anything. It was really cool because they&#8217;d never even had that. They&#8217;d set up a product cost inside of WooCommerce Cost of Goods, and there were some basic reports, but all of a sudden we were able just to bring that data in and kind of cleared it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It got to a point where we were just telling everyone to go and buy the Cost of Goods plugin. People were like, well, I don&#8217;t want to install a new plugin just to have a field on my product page to set the cost. That&#8217;s very fair, especially when they don&#8217;t need the reports and the other functionality from it. So we decided to build it into the app. Of course, it morphed into something much bigger. We got shipping transaction, extra cost. You can say a lot of people want us to do their monthly salary costs and office expenses. They really want to have a bigger picture of things. We&#8217;re not really meant to be an accounting or profit tool in that way, but over time it&#8217;s kind of becoming that. People want more and more from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the other cool things you can do as a SaaS when it comes to this kind of thing is we integrate with Google Ads, TikTok ads, Facebook ads, all these different providers to let people bring in their live advertising costs from those platforms. It starts to be a really cool experience as a user because you&#8217;re getting all this data from different places in one location and getting to actually report on it, aggregate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />What&#8217;s keeping the other 70-odd percent or so from doing the same? Is it a knowledge thing about whether they don&#8217;t know that that exists or is it an industry thing where it doesn&#8217;t make sense for some folks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />I think industry plays a big part. Privacy is another issue. We don&#8217;t have it in a way, again, it was just kind of bolted onto the app. It wasn&#8217;t what we initially set out to do. We don&#8217;t have a way for you to just say, this user can see all the reports, but they can&#8217;t see the cost and profit. That&#8217;s a common thing that a store owner might want to hide from their team. They want them in there using metrics for the reports. A lot of users have asked us to do that and we&#8217;ll probably do that soon. I think that would increase adoption a little bit. But also, we&#8217;re not trying to be an app for them to figure out their profit and pay taxes on. We don&#8217;t encourage it in that way. When people come to proper reporting, they&#8217;re probably looking for that level of detail. They need to incorporate all their costs across the whole thing, salary to everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interesting part on our end starts to be trying to figure out reports based on that. We added these reports to the app a few months ago for doing cohorts, customer cohorts based on when they join by the month they join, week they join, or maybe the first product or first coupon they use. It&#8217;s really cool to split your customers up into those cohorts automatically and then see the lifetime profit and profit margin over time, how that changes. Then you start to understand not just at what point a customer has spent enough that they&#8217;ve reached a target revenue per customer, but they&#8217;ve actually become profitable. You can measure that and be like, by month 14, we know on average that&#8217;s where we&#8217;ve got enough profit from each customer. I love that part of it more than being an accounting tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />It&#8217;s really helping WooCommerce store owners to run their company as a proper business. A lot are more hobbyist sites and it helps to bring them to the next level. Some of them will already be doing that, of course, but a lot of WooCommerce store owners don&#8217;t do that kind of thing. This is really making it much more accessible. I&#8217;m kind of wishing I use WooCommerce on my own website. I use Easy Digital Downloads and I can&#8217;t access any of this because quite sensibly you&#8217;ve built this for WooCommerce and Shopify, the two biggest players. I get that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />I have had some requests for EDD, but every single request has come from people I knew in the community who would want it. Then I start to think about how many stores that is and it&#8217;s maybe a couple of hundred that I know would pay for it as well. It starts to be a little harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah, totally agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />But I&#8217;ve always wanted to build it for EDD because all my friends and all my colleagues are using EDD rather than Woo. At the start, it wasn&#8217;t like I could really contact too many of my friends running WordPress businesses and say, please use my product because they were using EDD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />You mentioned earlier about maybe they should put something in core related to the cost of goods. I was thinking that when I saw your stat about subscriptions, 28% of all the WooCommerce stores that you track use subscriptions. The vast majority of them will be WooCommerce subscriptions to one specific plugin, of course. I know they will never put that in core because they must make so much money from that premium only add-on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />I don&#8217;t think they make enough from it to be honest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Because it&#8217;s so valuable in recurring revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Exactly. It&#8217;s one thing that we&#8217;d probably do next year and we want to improve in a report based on the feedback, but also just based on what I think would be interesting is actually saying, while maybe it&#8217;s 27% of stores that have subscriptions on, does that actually account for more like 40-50% of the revenue or are those stores by default on average double or triple stores that don&#8217;t have subscriptions? We didn&#8217;t go into that and I think we&#8217;d like to expand on that, but I think that would actually show that while maybe 27-30% are using subscriptions, those stores tend to be much more successful because it&#8217;s such a great business model if you can make it work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, absolutely. I want to shift gears a tiny little bit and talk about, you have a couple of slides in here about the top themes and plugins in WooCommerce stores. Looking at the top themes and plugins, I see Elementor ranking pretty high in both and Classic Editor at number five in the top plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Not too surprised to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, native WordPress right now with full site editing isn&#8217;t quite ready to handle the majority of WooCommerce stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Well, I think that indicates that there&#8217;s still a heavy dependence on the Classic Editor for sure. A lot of that might come through other builders that are being used, but also maybe other WooCommerce plugins and stuff that aren&#8217;t quite there yet. I know even for us, we&#8217;ve been integrating with commerce blocks and stuff for the checkout recently for an update we&#8217;ve been working on. I think a lot of the filters that we needed were only added in a WooCommerce version that just came out or is about to come out. That&#8217;s certainly fine if things take time and it&#8217;s good to take time to get it right, but if we&#8217;re an app that&#8217;s trying to really stay ahead and move with Woo, we were really only able to integrate with some of those features in a version that&#8217;s just coming out now on June 24. It&#8217;s going to take time for that shift to happen, maybe longer than anyone&#8217;s expecting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus, while you mentioned that, it makes me think about a part of the report that I found a little surprising and actually came out of a discussion I had recently about PHP versions. I noticed that 7.4 is still at 45% of WooCommerce stores that we&#8217;re tracking. I think that&#8217;s actually higher than the average across all of WordPress generally. There is that kind of fear when it comes to an ecommerce store. Upgrades come at a very big cost if it messes up. If your site goes down or if something&#8217;s incompatible and you have downtime, it&#8217;s not just downtime, it&#8217;s losing money time. That&#8217;s a very valid concern for an ecommerce store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, one of the other stats that just screamed off the page at me was that the average number of active plugins is 58 on a WooCommerce store. So compatibility-wise, you have to make sure that all 58 of those are ready to move beyond PHP 7.4 before you upgrade. But also, why so many and what do the annual costs look like? Not all of those plugins are going to be free. I know a lot of WooCommerce plugins cost an annual fee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Yeah. I think we are always, and I think that comes with a caveat with this report, we&#8217;re looking at stores that are willing to pay us, Metorik, as an app, at least $20 a month, and in most cases, $100 plus a month for an app for their WooCommerce store. They aren&#8217;t reflective of every WooCommerce store. I think with that means they&#8217;re willing to spend for sure at least two, $3,000 a year on their website if they&#8217;re willing to pay that much to us as an app for their website. It&#8217;s reasonable to think that most of them would have 10, 20 plus active subscriptions, but with that cost comes so much value because a lot of these stores are doing significant numbers and significant volume. If they wanted to have a similar setup, an equivalent setup on another platform like Shopify, they would be looking at a larger annual cost for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I enjoyed the section about order milestones. I spent quite a while looking at that and trying to visualize the typical store and how long it takes them to get any significant momentum and so on. It is interesting to see that the majority, 76%, get to a thousand orders and it takes just over a year, whereas it&#8217;s a pretty small number that make a hundred thousand orders ever, which is 7.9%, and that takes multiple years. A million orders, which kind of makes sense, is only 1%. It&#8217;s interesting to see the</p>\n\n\n\n<p>dropoff. It made me wonder how WooCommerce compared with that regard to other platforms that might be more enterprise-tailored or something, whereas lots of WooCommerce stores are more small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Yeah, that&#8217;s a good point. Look, Shopify for sure, I think the number would be a bit quicker, but I don&#8217;t know necessarily how many are getting to that scale as well. I think it would be similar, but again, I do think it always comes back to if the store is investing a lot more in their online presence through paying more for the ecommerce platform, through spending more on hosting or developers or marketing costs, any of those things, they&#8217;re typically going to be a bigger store. I think WooCommerce by default is a cheaper option, so you do tend to get stores that invest less in marketing at the start. But then that&#8217;s what we saw that I found really interesting with this report. You kind of get to that a hundred K, and we didn&#8217;t have enough time to really show a good picture between that a hundred and a million, but you scale so much faster at that point because you&#8217;ve already got the momentum, you&#8217;ve already got the infrastructure set up, and probably more than anything, you&#8217;re at a point in the business where you want to invest in marketing and other ways to improve your store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />It kind of fits with a theory I&#8217;ve been developing about the way that WordPress and WooCommerce are growing more widely. If you look at data on Built With, which I was looking at yesterday, I think I tweeted about it actually, if you look at WordPress and WooCommerce&#8217;s growth for the top hundred thousand sites, the top million sites, they&#8217;re actually going down a bit. They&#8217;re declining, but then if you tick the whole internet box on Built With, they&#8217;re going up quite rapidly. So that says to me that the growth is in the smaller websites, and I thought that might fit with your data that the majority have a smaller number of orders as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Yeah. I think the tricky thing with all of those numbers that are out there with Built With in different companies that try to track the state of ecommerce across the whole internet is that we just don&#8217;t know how many of those sites are actually operating and have at least 20 sales a year. You&#8217;ve got to learn a hundred, and I think really the number of stores that is like sub a hundred orders a year is the majority probably. And that&#8217;s okay. There&#8217;s still so many stores out there that are doing larger numbers, but especially with sites that are just being set up and not running, you can do that basically for free on WooCommerce. We always have to take those numbers with a grain of salt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah, I was looking at that chart as well. Less than 10% of stores make it to that a hundred thousand plus orders mark within an average time of four years or so to make it to this milestone. Why do you think stores don&#8217;t stick it out? The average time to a million plus is like six years. Is it just a patience issue? Do people just need to be in it for the long run? Do people give up too early?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Maybe. Maybe they&#8217;ve switched platforms as well. It&#8217;s hard to really paint that picture in a report like this, but it&#8217;s something that we see tends to happen. Stores get to a certain size and they end up then wanting to try a different platform, become Shopify or something custom. I&#8217;ve seen stores go to Magento, and so I think that sometimes can be a reason. But also it&#8217;s just really hard to get to that scale. You see people on Shopify, especially because they send out these trophies and things like that to commemorate when you get to certain milestones, they send a physical item. I think you order it through them to merchants and you see people posting on Twitter, but the reality is there aren&#8217;t that many stores that are getting a million plus orders. That&#8217;s a big volume. If you&#8217;re doing a hundred plus average AOV, that&#8217;s like a hundred million. So a more realistic average Woo store, I don&#8217;t think we published it in it. The number I was seeing was something like off the top of my head, 30, 40,000 orders, something around that bracket. But that&#8217;s still massive, especially if an average order is a hundred dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />The ones that are switching platforms, what is making them want to do that? What is WooCommerce not doing well at a hundred thousand or a million orders?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />That&#8217;s probably an episode in itself just because it&#8217;s such a big thing to unpack. At that scale, stores are thinking about what matters to them. What I&#8217;ve found, it&#8217;s not even about reliability, but having someone to depend on. I think Shopify does that well. It&#8217;s like a safety net. A merchant running on that, even if their site does go down, it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s going down with every other Shopify site and that gives them some confidence. Shopify&#8217;s reliability recently has been really good. So a lot of it is peace of mind. Merchants don&#8217;t want to be technical. They don&#8217;t want to get in the weeds that much. They really just want to run their shop and not think about plugin updates or anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I see a lot of WooCommerce agencies now pop up that are focusing on maintenance plans and things like that, that&#8217;s really good and a step in the right direction. But it needs to come as well with the reliability or the escape, the reassurance that someone&#8217;s got your back if the site goes down and you&#8217;re not going to lose your order data and things like that. The cost to a store if their site goes down and they have to restore to a backup and it&#8217;s eight hours before, and in that time they had orders, it&#8217;s such a big cost that it would almost pay for a subscription for Shopify or something else in a year. If it&#8217;s going to solve it by going to one of those platforms, they&#8217;re going to do it. There needs to be enough upside for them to stay with Woo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a lot of stores, subscriptions are amazing and above, beyond what most subscription platforms that exist for Shopify allow. The cost of running on Woo is low. If you can do that at scale and you can really optimize your site and handle how you tackle downtime, but also have a good backup plan, have a good recovery plan, then you start to save several hundred thousand a year with Woo if you&#8217;re a big store and maybe even a million plus if you&#8217;re doing tens of millions a year in revenue. Woo has a lot of advantages. It&#8217;s just about finding the disadvantages and trying to solve them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Marcus, did you have any questions about the average order stuff or the refunds?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />I had one. You have a note on the refund section that physical goods are refunded at lower amounts than software because of the low overhead for software. In general, the outlier here seems to be clothing and footwear. I think I have an idea, but what makes that industry have the highest refund rate?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />It&#8217;s probably one of the most compelling things you can offer as a business in that industry is free returns and really to almost encourage them and say, order from us as much as you want, and then the few things you don&#8217;t want to send it back will include a free return bag because that&#8217;s really how those stores start to get higher AOV. I think it&#8217;s a symptom of that, but it&#8217;s probably by design and it probably does actually increase the AOV for that industry quite a lot more than what it would be without it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I see that online learning has an 85% refund rate, which is kind of scary because it makes me think that people are abusing it potentially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Oh no, that&#8217;s only 85% of the refund amount, not refund rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Oh, okay. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />I&#8217;d be surprised if they were doing well enough to keep running their shop with that much of a refund rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Oh, the amounts 1.5%. Yeah, that&#8217;s better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Exactly. The one that we want to highlight with the refund amount was just to show, when a refund does happen, is it a full refund? Is it a partial one? I found that interesting with some consumable ones like food and beverage, the refund amount on average is 56%. That would indicate that a lot of stores are doing partial refunds. Maybe one of the items they&#8217;re not happy with is not worth the cost of returning it, while software or online learning, it&#8217;s 80-85% because it&#8217;s a digital item. You can effectively refund the whole thing without incurring a major cost as a store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Those are a little harder to partially refund too. Refund a handful of lessons from a course. You&#8217;re either refunding the course or you&#8217;re not refunding the course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Exactly. You might as well, if you&#8217;re having a credit cost as a software business, just find a solution like that. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve experienced the thing, both of you, over the years with WooCommerce and WordPress support. Sometimes just to solve it, let them move on, give them a refund rather than try to hold on to 70 or 80% of the money or even 20-30% of the money. Risk covering someone who really has it out for you after that and wouldn&#8217;t speak favorably about you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I thought the devices section was interesting. We&#8217;ll all have heard many stats way before this report that the majority of online shoppers are using mobile devices. I&#8217;ve always kind of ignored that on my own website because we sell WordPress plugins. The vast majority are sitting at their desks on their desktops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />What percent is, in your case?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I can&#8217;t remember off the top of my head, but it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know, 70 or 80% or something on desktop, which makes sense. You don&#8217;t buy a plugin on your phone, do you? You&#8217;re at work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />I hadn&#8217;t realized that we had this in the report, I forgot,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>but it says it there. Software stores have the most desktop-driven customers with 79% of orders being placed on a desktop device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Which makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />That checks out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />For other industries, obviously mobile&#8217;s important for my business as well, but it&#8217;s more so for things like clothes where people are buying from their sofas and so on. It was interesting seeing that the average order value placed on desktop is significantly higher than people ordering on their mobiles. Even if you are in a mobile-first industry, you do really need to think about those desktop users because even if they&#8217;re buying clothes or something that suggests to me that they&#8217;re having a serious session of buying clothes, they&#8217;re sitting at their computer, got multiple tabs open, it&#8217;s a very different experience and they spend more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />That&#8217;s a good point. Another common one is if you&#8217;re buying an appliance or an electronic product, a lot of those decisions are made at the computer where you can really take the time to research, look at five different tabs and then check out. That&#8217;s a kind of trend with a lot of these numbers. A lot of them aren&#8217;t as surprising, but the actual level that the number ended up at, in this case, 38 to 62, I didn&#8217;t know that until we pulled that. Actually, to be fair, I didn&#8217;t realize that the desktop AOV would be that much higher. If you just asked me off the top of my head, I would&#8217;ve guessed anecdotally 30-40%, not almost double. I think it just comes down to when you&#8217;re doing a high-value order, when you are spending several hundred dollars in a shop, you&#8217;re going to probably do it on a computer. Typically they&#8217;re going to move to a desktop for those transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Yeah. I also was interested for the same reason in that section. It kind of made me think about my purchasing habits and maybe how important it is for stores to have carts that you can move between mobile and desktop via login or something. I spend a lot of time browsing on my mobile device and I&#8217;ll toss things in the cart, but then by the time I&#8217;m ready to make a purchase, I might hop over to the computer. I&#8217;ve got desktop extensions that help with coupon codes and all of that kind of thing that I can take advantage of that I don&#8217;t have on my mobile device. Really a lot of the purchasing, I would guess that I&#8217;m not in the minority, that there&#8217;s a lot of folks that are browsing on their mobile and then making an actual final purchase on their desktop, especially like you said, with high order value items and orders and stuff. Just being able to, Amazon obviously, right? I&#8217;ll toss a bunch of things in an Amazon cart and then, because I&#8217;m logged in, I can log back in on the computer and finish that order. The importance of having a system like that, maybe for even smaller stores to be able to jump between devices and keep your cart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />It&#8217;s an interesting product idea, really. I think we kind of do that, and a lot of plugins do that in a small way through abandoned cart tracking and being able to send a link that just restores it in one click, which is close. But I&#8217;m just thinking about, it&#8217;d be quite cool, even just a simple plugin that was just like, send me a link right now just to access this cart on a computer. That would probably have some value rather than being this whole thing to track carts. It can tie into that, but I think just as a core feature, I want to move this cart to a desktop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Speaking of recovered carts, I also saw in the report that the average order value of recovered carts is about 30% higher than even regular placed orders. The report states it&#8217;s because customers tend to add multiple items into their cart before making a decision. Then they get that abandoned cart link and they come back and place the order. What are some good abandoned cart strategies to recover these carts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Offer an incentive, and I think the incentive should be specific to your store and the situation you&#8217;re in. There&#8217;s no one size fits all. We kind of lead into this in one of the other pages where we talk about later in the report to do with the AOV of free shipping versus paid shipping orders. Something interesting with that is figuring out where your AOV is. In that case, if we&#8217;re looking at the cart report, it&#8217;s around 120, which is where the average cart value was when they got placed. Maybe you&#8217;d be wanting to incentivize people to spend over 150 and get free shipping or over 150 and get 10% off because at least then you&#8217;re increasing your AOV by 40-50% at the cost of a 10-15% discount. I think that&#8217;s one way, but otherwise, it&#8217;s also about using the moment when you try to recover a cart as a marketing opportunity. It&#8217;s not just saying, recover your cart, but maybe you should also add this item based on what you already have in your cart. It ends up being an actual win for the customer because they might discover something that they didn&#8217;t know about, and they&#8217;re getting a better deal with maybe they&#8217;re getting free shipping as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />I didn&#8217;t see in the report numbers on the percentage of stores using abandoned cart recovery versus not using abandoned cart recovery practices. Do you have maybe anecdotal numbers on how many people are actually taking advantage of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />That&#8217;s a good question. Again, in our case, it&#8217;s all limited to the scope of Metorik because someone would have to turn on the cart tracking feature. We have then opted to pay extra for our email feature to send an abandoned cart email, which is why we didn&#8217;t go too deep into that because it&#8217;s just not big enough scale to be too insightful. Of the stores actually adding, anecdotally, it&#8217;s like 20-30% of our stores are trying to recover carts, not enough. It&#8217;s very common that I&#8217;ll meet really successful stores that are doing significant numbers but aren&#8217;t really focusing on abandoned cart recovery, but also failed order recovery and really simple actions like that alone will pay for the cost of Metorik or any other plugin or app to do it. You just need to recover several carts and you can recover the cost of the software to do it. It&#8217;s worth investing in for almost any business. Again, it depends on the industry and the business and the brand and all those factors. It&#8217;s never one size fits all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />Katie, is that something that you guys think about for the plugins? I don&#8217;t know how that works with EDD or any of the setup that you guys have. I know that you have demos with InstaWP, and you&#8217;re tracking all that stuff too. Is abandoned cart recovery something that you guys talk about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Yeah. I miss Jilt. I know you used to work for that company. That was the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Jilt was such a great product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Such a shame. We now use Recapture, which is nowhere near as good as Jilt was, but it kind of does the job. The data isn&#8217;t brilliant. It&#8217;s pretty basic, but we do recover a lot of carts that way, which as Bryce said, more than pays for Recapture. We also use it for post-purchase emails, like sending a discount code to people a few days after they make a purchase and stuff like that. We do get our money&#8217;s worth out of Recapture. There isn&#8217;t, for Easy Digital Downloads, a particularly professional abandoned cart solution. I think a lot of mailing list providers like MailChimp and so on integrate with WooCommerce as well as you having your own paid feature, Bryce, as well. Hopefully it&#8217;s better for WooCommerce than EDD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />There&#8217;s definitely more options for Woo. I don&#8217;t think, again, Woo is typically a second-class citizen in a way on every platform. They&#8217;ll tend to just do it as an afterthought, so you don&#8217;t get maybe enough tracked or accuracy when it comes to carts. A lot of our cart tracking was inspired by Jilt. I think the whole team did such a good job on that product. We took a lot of inspiration from that. Klaviyo and all those apps that do integrate with Woo, MailChimp, they&#8217;re going to be thinking about Woo once every few months. It&#8217;s not like an active daily thought in how they develop and improve the product. It&#8217;s really fun for me to try to prioritize Woo and think, how can I make the best possible product for these merchants that typically aren&#8217;t getting anything made for them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />On the country and currency section, I thought it was strange that there&#8217;s a significantly higher average order value when the customer is not in the store&#8217;s default currency. So if it&#8217;s a store in the US and they offer in British pounds, then there&#8217;d be a higher average order value on average than the US dollars. I can&#8217;t think of any reason why. Can you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Yeah, no, definitely. I think it actually leads into two pages forward where we talk about, or several pages forward where we talk about delivery distances and how people typically spend more when they&#8217;re ordering from further away. A lot of it comes down to when you are ordering from a store in a remote area, it&#8217;s a bigger deal. You might have to pay more for shipping. It might be something you can do less frequently because of the cost. The average order tends to be higher because of that reason, where they&#8217;re trying to maximize that moment where they are making a purchase. It does lead into that idea where stores that offer free shipping end up having a higher AOV, and that can encourage higher spending. If you&#8217;re in an international country paying in a different currency, that free shipping could make a difference and make you spend a lot more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I do that all the time. Being in Australia, most of the things I&#8217;m buying online are from overseas, and I will always spend even double or triple to get free shipping, which isn&#8217;t logical in that way, but no one likes</p>\n\n\n\n<p>paying for shipping. I don&#8217;t want to pay 20 pounds to ship something from the UK. I would much rather just pay 300 pounds and get free shipping, but I get 300 pounds worth of items. It&#8217;s a weird thing, but I think a lot of people I spoke to about this report, especially Australian people, but really anyone American ordering from Europe or Europe ordering from America or Asia from anywhere in the world, you want to maximize those purchases to get free shipping, but also it might just not be something you do frequently because you have to wait several weeks for the delivery to come. So you want to spend a bit more instead of something local where you can order several times in a week and it&#8217;s not going to be that much of a delay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />I&#8217;m an Amazon Prime member, like many folks, at least in the US, probably all over the world, so I&#8217;m used to the free shipping. I was going to say, it&#8217;s no surprise that free shipping increases the average order value, but also I&#8217;m wondering if we&#8217;ve all been kind of conditioned to expect free shipping as an option. It shows in the report that about two-thirds of stores are offering it. What advice would you have for the third of stores that are not yet offering free shipping? Is it just a barrier for them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />I don&#8217;t remember if we actually had the number of stores that offer free shipping, but I know that 66% of orders did have free shipping, which as a sheer number of orders is significant. But I&#8217;m curious, for stores that don&#8217;t offer free shipping, is that just a no-brainer that you should offer free shipping? That&#8217;ll basically guarantee a higher average order value?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not necessarily on every order, especially if your shipping costs are high. It&#8217;s feasible, but you need to figure out what is your shipping cost. Not just what you&#8217;re charging customers, because a lot of stores tend to charge a bit more. What&#8217;s your actual cost? What would your cost be if you were able to have double the number of orders because you&#8217;re offering free shipping? The cost might come down with that volume. But I would say figure out your cost and then factor that in. If I know my average cost is $9 and my average order is $50, if I could make free shipping over 90 or 80, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m getting 30, $40 more revenue at a cost of nine or $10. It typically comes down to that, figuring out where you&#8217;re at, but where you want to get to. Free shipping is just a lever to get there. Abandoned cart discounts are another way, multiple different paths, and it depends on the store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />That fits quite nicely into the page about delivery distances and where you talk about how far away people are ordering. It looks like the majority of stores are doing proper shipping, and they&#8217;re not just delivering pizza places delivering within a few miles. There&#8217;s a lot of people delivering, even thousands of kilometers, aren&#8217;t there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Yeah, I think I&#8217;m just looking at that report as well. Sure, under a thousand kilometers looks like it&#8217;s around 50% of orders. But that&#8217;s a significant number of orders that are going a further distance, which is great. That&#8217;s what ecommerce is about. It&#8217;s about enabling people to buy the items that they normally couldn&#8217;t get locally. Being in a pretty remote place like Australia, you really appreciate it. So much stuff I love that I have to get from overseas. In my case, every order is traveling 10,000k or more. That probably brings it up a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus:<br />You alone are making up that 3% of orders that travel more than 10,000 kilometers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />In some industries, maybe. I did buy a lot of stuff from the UK recently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I never knew that about Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Of course, we have so many amazing Australian brands and products and companies to buy from, but if you&#8217;re into a niche thing, I really love synthesizers. A lot of that&#8217;s not coming from Australia or records as well. They&#8217;re coming from America, Japan, places like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />I have a similar issue in Spain. Nearly everything is not available from Spain and I need to order it from elsewhere. So then there is that, depending on where you live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />It goes back to that if you are ordering from somewhere domestically in Spain, you don&#8217;t need to really maximize that order as much as you are ordering from the states and have to incur shipping. You&#8217;d probably want to add a couple more items because you&#8217;re not going to make that order from the US every week, but you might do that domestically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie:<br />Well, thank you so much, Bryce. That&#8217;s been really interesting, and I think it&#8217;s given us some good perspectives on WooCommerce that we never had access to before. So that&#8217;s really helpful. Thank you so much. Before we finish, can you tell us where we can find you online and also where we can read the report in full?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bryce:<br />Yeah, of course. For me, I&#8217;m on Twitter at BryceAdams. I don&#8217;t tweet much, but I&#8217;m trying to be better and taking a lot of inspiration from you, Katie, to try to engage more. The report is on Metorik at <a href=\"https://metorik.com/woocommerce-insights\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://metorik.com/woocommerce-insights</a>. I hope people love it and really let us know your feedback because if there are metrics that people want or would find useful for their business, we want to include those next year. A lot of this was just done on what we thought people would want, but we really do want to build it for not just our customers, but the WooCommerce community.

This launch coincides with the first day of WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2018, Do the Woo has evolved through continuously, growing both in content and community engagement. The decision to move Do the Woo to its own site in late 2022 was the first major step for the future. As we entered 2023, our mission began to extend beyond WooCommerce to encompass the broader WordPress ecosystem. The idea was simple: elevate voices and create a podcast by the community, for the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of 2023, planning for the new started and in October, we solidified our efforts, with the goal of showcasing the diverse range of the Do the Woo podcast channel with our shows. With significant support from WordPress.com, this vision became a reality, culminating in a redesigned site that went live in March.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, we start our prelaunch. The official launch will be on June 13, 2024, when we will proudly unveil the fully developed Do the Woo 4.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Features of Do the Woo 4.0</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Comprehensive Podcast Lineup:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the official launch, we now have a total of <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/our-shows/\">12 shows</a> and <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/about-the-woocommerce-builder-community/\">26 hosts</a>, including our latest addition focused on <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/podcasts/scaling-enterprise-wordpress-and-open-source-software/\">enterprise WordPress and open-source software (OSS)</a>. <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/our-shows/\">Each show has its own dedicated page</a>, allowing listeners to learn about the series, explore past episodes, and subscribe to their favorite content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our top priority was to provide an easy way for listeners to subscribe to the shows they want. They can subscribe to individual shows or opt for the full Do the Woo feed if they want to stay updated on all content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Global Community Representation:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/about-the-woocommerce-builder-community/\">About page</a> features a dynamic map showcasing our hosts, sponsors, and guests from around the world. This interactive feature highlights the global reach and diverse backgrounds of our contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Support for Hosts</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve introduced a <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/support/\">new support option</a> on our site, allowing listeners to support specific shows and their volunteer hosts.

Write articles for frequently asked questions to reduce support requests and provide instant answers to users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-customer-driven-development\">Customer-Driven Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus on customer feedback to guide the development of new features. Use a feature request page where users can submit and vote on new ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-support-automation\">Support Automation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Automate support as much as possible. Use tools to recommend knowledge base articles based on user queries and streamline the support process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-efficient-time-management\">Efficient Time Management</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prioritize tasks by balancing between reactive updates (e.g., API changes) and proactive development of new features based on customer demand and potential business impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-collaborate-with-third-parties\">Collaborate with Third Parties</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Work with third-party developers and services to extend the functionality of your plugin. This helps in managing integrations and keeping your plugin up-to-date.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-profitability-focus\">Profitability Focus</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintain a high level of profitability by being cautious about hiring. Consider hiring only when the workload becomes unmanageable and impacts personal life significantly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-multi-function-roles\">Multi-Function Roles</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When hiring, look for individuals who can handle multiple roles, including support, development, and representation at events, to maximize efficiency and reduce costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-self-service-tools\">Self-Service Tools</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Develop tools that allow users to solve their problems without contacting support. This includes automated responses and a robust support form that guides users to the right resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-selective-feature-development\">Selective Feature Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all feature requests should be built. Focus on those that benefit a broader audience and align with your plugins primary use cases. Niche or highly specific requests can often be handled through custom code or third-party services.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-marketing-and-visibility\">Marketing and Visibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Actively market your plugin by demonstrating its capabilities and forming relationships within the WordPress community. Participate in podcasts, write articles, and engage on social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-balance-work-and-personal-life\">Balance Work and Personal Life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure your work does not negatively impact your personal life. Be mindful of your working hours and make adjustments when necessary to maintain a healthy work-life balance.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"Do The Woo Community: 12 Public Relation Tips for WordPress and WooCommerce Businesses\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=6707\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://dothewoo.io/12-public-relation-tips-for-wordpress-and-woocommerce-businesses/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3590:\"<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/adding-public-relations-to-your-wordpress-or-woo-biz-stack/\"><strong>Woo BizChat</strong></a>, hosts Emma and Adam talked about the benefits of PR for WordPress specific businesses. Adam is a PR specialist that is founder of <strong><a href=\"https://cirrusinfluence.com/\">Cirrus Influence</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Start with the why:</strong> Before starting a PR campaign or diving into networking events like WordCamps, clarify the purpose and objectives behind your efforts. Understanding the &#8220;why&#8221; will guide your actions and decisions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Identify your tribe:</strong> Find the communities or groups where your target audience is active and engage with them. Building relationships within these communities can provide invaluable support and opportunities for collaboration.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Be bold and persistent:</strong> Don&#8217;t be afraid to reach out to potential partners or event organizers. Even if you receive a &#8220;no&#8221; initially, don&#8217;t be discouraged. Seek constructive feedback and consider alternative approaches for future endeavors.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Develop your expertise:</strong> Continuously work on improving and sharing your knowledge and expertise. Consider giving talks at local meetups or WordCamps to establish yourself as an industry expert.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Practice public speaking:</strong> Engage in activities like Toastmasters to improve your public speaking skills. Confidence in presenting your ideas is crucial for effective communication and networking.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Embrace confidence:</strong> Confidence doesn&#8217;t come from external validation. You have to believe in yourself and your capabilities. Take the initiative and recognize your own potential.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoid hard-selling tactics:</strong> When participating in events or engaging with potential customers, focus on building relationships rather than pushing sales. Provide value and focus on becoming a trusted resource for your audience.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep track of data and feedback:</strong> Gather data and feedback from your PR activities to assess what is working and what needs improvement. Data points, whether positive or negative, provide insights for refining your PR strategies.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Engage in the margin:</strong> Allocate resources and opportunities for creative marketing initiatives. Having some margin allows you to experiment with brand-building activities and sustain long-term growth.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Utilize WordCamps as relationship building:</strong> Attend and sponsor WordCamps with the intention of building relationships rather than solely emphasizing direct sales. Use these events to connect with the WordPress community and establish your brand identity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t wait for confidence:</strong> Confidence is an internal decision. Don&#8217;t wait for external validation or a sudden surge of belief in your abilities. Take charge of your confidence and trust in your potential to make things happen.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Seek encouragement within:</strong> Ultimately, the motivation and encouragement you need comes from within. Don&#8217;t rely solely on external sources for validation. Embrace self-encouragement and belief in your journey.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Listen to the full episode here: <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/adding-public-relations-to-your-wordpress-or-woo-biz-stack/\">Adding Public Relations to Your WordPress or Woo Biz Stack</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Do The Woo Community: 10 Ways to Boost Your WordPress Affiliate Program\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=6726\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://dothewoo.io/10-ways-to-boost-your-wordpress-affiliate-program/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3224:\"<p>Creating and running an affiliate program for your WordPress products or services can be overwhelming and challenging. Alex Standiford is asking everyone to rethink affiliate programs. Here are 10 ideas that may spark something new in your affiliate program.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Consider Diverse Performance-Based Programs</strong>: Look beyond traditional affiliate models and consider partnerships that offer payouts based on specific performance metrics, such as driving traffic, customer satisfaction, or content engagement, in addition to sales.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Focus on Quality Over Quantity</strong>: Rather than targeting a large number of affiliates, aim to work closely with a smaller group of committed affiliates who are aligned with your brand and have the potential for significant conversions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Develop Personalized Partnerships</strong>: Foster stronger relationships with affiliates by providing personalized support, workflow insights, and one-on-one consultations to maximize their success.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Explore Profit Margin-based Payouts</strong>: Determine payout percentages based on your profit margins, ensuring that the compensation aligns with the value brought in by affiliates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Emphasize Collaboration Among Affiliates</strong>: Allow for multiple affiliates to earn credit for the same sale, encouraging collaboration and teamwork among the affiliates rather than fostering competition.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Evaluate the Long-term Commitment of Affiliates</strong>: Understand the level of commitment required for your products or services, especially for items with significant user loyalty, such as recurring payment services, and consider tailored affiliate approaches for each category.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Avoid Over-reliance on Volume-based Traffic</strong>: Challenge the effectiveness of purely volume-based traffic and explore more nuanced and sustainable strategies to create a more targeted and engaged audience.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Encourage Allyship and Teamwork Among Affiliates</strong>: Foster an environment where affiliates can work together as allies, leveraging each other&#8217;s strengths to attract and convert traffic, encouraging specialized roles and collaboration for improved performance.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consider Tailored Affiliate Programs</strong>: Explore the possibility of customizing affiliate programs to match specific niches, addressing the limitations of generic affiliate approaches and contributing to improved partnership outcomes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Prioritize In-depth Support and Education</strong>: Provide comprehensive resources, insights, and dedicated support to affiliates, setting up workflows to guide them through effective strategies and enable overall success.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You can learn about Alex&#8217;s WordPress plugin <strong><a href=\"https://www.sirenaffiliates.com/\">SirenAffilates.com</a></strong> and / or listen to the full episode on Do the Woo: <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/reimagining-affiliate-programs-for-your-woo-biz-with-alex-standiford/\"><strong>Reimagining Affiliate Programs for Your Woo Biz with Alex Standiford</strong></a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"Do The Woo Community: 12 Email Marketing Tips for WooCommerce and WordPress Businesses\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=6246\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://dothewoo.io/12-email-marketing-tips-for-woocommerce-and-wordpress-businesses/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6257:\"<p>In a podcast episode of <em><strong>Woo BizChat </strong></em>we had email marketing expert Greg Zakowicz from Omnisend chatting with Emma and Adam. Although it&#8217;s recommended that you listen to the full episode, <strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/email-marketing-tips-for-woo-and-wordpress-businesses/\">Email Marketing for Woo and WordPress Builders and Businesses with Greg Zakowicz</a></strong> , here are 12 tips to help with your WordPress or WooCommerce business, whether you create products or provide services.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-embrace-automation\">Embrace Automation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Greg emphasizes the effectiveness of automated emails, revealing that 41% of all email marketing orders sent by Omnisend customers came from automated messages. Automation allows you to send targeted and relevant messages based on the user&#8217;s behavior, making it a powerful tool for increasing engagement and conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-focus-on-high-intent-automated-messages\">Focus on High-Intent Automated Messages</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Greg highlights specific automated messages that drive results, including welcome messages, browse abandonment, and cart abandonment emails. These messages are high-intent and directly tied to user behavior, making them more likely to lead to conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-utilize-social-proof-in-subject-lines\">Utilize Social Proof in Subject Lines</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Greg suggests that subject lines featuring social proof, such as top-rated products or five-star reviews, can capture attention. Incorporating elements that highlight the quality and popularity of your products or services can make your emails more appealing to recipients.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-experiment-with-emojis-in-subject-lines\">Experiment with Emojis in Subject Lines</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite not being a new concept, Greg emphasizes the continued effectiveness of using emojis in subject lines. Emojis can help break up the visual monotony, especially on mobile devices, making your emails stand out in crowded inboxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-optimize-for-mobile-and-visual-appeal\">Optimize for Mobile and Visual Appeal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Greg discusses the importance of visual elements, white space, and breaking up text to make emails visually appealing. Since many users access emails on their mobile devices, optimizing for mobile responsiveness and creating visually engaging content can enhance the overall user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-clean-inactive-contacts-regularly\">Clean Inactive Contacts Regularly</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Greg emphasizes the importance of cleaning inactive contacts from your email list to maintain deliverability and engagement rates. Sending emails to inactive contacts can negatively impact your sender reputation and result in lower inbox placement. Regularly clean your list, preferably twice a year, to remove subscribers who haven&#8217;t engaged in a significant period.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-understand-and-monitor-email-deliverability-requirements\">Understand and Monitor Email Deliverability Requirements</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay informed about email deliverability requirements, such as authentication protocols like DKIM, DMARC, and SPF. Greg mentions that Google and Yahoo have implemented new deliverability requirements, and compliance with these standards is crucial for proving your legitimacy as a sender and avoiding potential deliverability issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-benchmark-against-yourself-not-just-industry-averages\">Benchmark Against Yourself, Not Just Industry Averages</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While industry benchmarks can provide useful insights, Greg advises marketers to primarily benchmark against their own performance. Focus on improving your open rates and click-through rates over time rather than comparing yourself solely to industry averages, as different list-cleaning practices can significantly impact these benchmarks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-leverage-competitive-differentiators-in-email-templates\">Leverage Competitive Differentiators in Email Templates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When creating email templates, highlight competitive differentiators such as free shipping, fast delivery, and customer service policies. Templatize this information to make it highly visible in your emails, catering to the specific intent of users who are looking for such value propositions when deciding whether to engage with your email content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-templatize-social-proof-and-value-propositions\">Templatize Social Proof and Value Propositions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporate social proof, customer testimonials, and value propositions into your email templates. Whether it&#8217;s showcasing five-star reviews, testimonials about great customer service, or emphasizing hassle-free returns, templatizing this content can build confidence and address potential obstacles to conversion, ultimately increasing click-through rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-implement-automated-retargeting-sequences\">Implement Automated Retargeting Sequences</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Greg emphasizes the importance of setting up automated retargeting sequences based on user behavior. Whether it&#8217;s a browse abandonment or cart abandonment, these automated sequences can significantly improve the chances of reengaging with users who have shown interest in your products.

And you&#8217;re sitting there thinking, am I just like a WordPress advocate or do I actually know what I&#8217;m talking about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think in many ways, when Matt, years ago, 2015, what was it 2015 when he said learn JavaScript deeply, I think now it&#8217;s learn marketing deeply. That&#8217;s what I think should be WordPress&#8217;s mission for the next two years because we are in a time when we&#8217;ve gone boom bust and we have an opportunity to seize right now as companies are looking at down rounds and they&#8217;re laying off staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the first places they cut is R&amp;D and innovation, and we have an opportunity to catch up on that ground. Not that we have to necessarily build a lot of stuff at all. I don&#8217;t even think we have to build that stuff, but I think we have to just do a much better job of product marketing at <strong>three, four or five levels of niches</strong>. And to me, it doesn&#8217;t mean that those couple niches define what WordPress is. There are just merely abstractions and narratives that sit on top of the WordPress we know today.

It&#8217;s this whole ecosystem. And are we even aware of the fact that we&#8217;re using this code? Well, I think it&#8217;s a problematic thing, and I have my opinions on how we should solve this in an ideal world. Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not the one who gets to decide that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in my ideal world, we would have a WordPress app store where WordPress plugins, the plugin repository would not just be for free plugins, but would also be for commercial plugins. And we take a percentage of sales there and put that money to work on stuff like this and lots of other things. I think that would make WordPress better for everyone. We could how we want plugins to sell their things, and we couldn&#8217;t enforce all the proper legalities there that are needed, and we could fund the companies and the projects that we need that we all need to, well, to sustain our work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-and-there-is-so-much-more\">And there is so much more&#8230;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that was the perfect world for Joost.

One suggestion that Sabrina made was that they come up a a few step for a developer who is not performance expert but they notice or they feel like you feel like the website is acting slow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s fronted or backend. It was fine a month ago and now it&#8217;s acting weirdly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-using-a-query-monitor\">Using a Query Monitor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing I would recommend is so easy. So this is not a developer tool, but it&#8217;s easy if you can add a plugin that is a query monitor. It can show you if there is some error on the site or if there are some slow queries to the database. So again, I know that there are developers going to say you can see slow queries, MySQL queries on the server. So that is advanced thing, the simplest thing, add a plugin and track, not the best thing, but you can see there if there are some issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-checking-the-logs\">Checking the Logs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If a query monitor doesn&#8217;t reveal anything or important, then I would suggest now depending on your hosting and server provider, you can check logs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say for the people that are not experienced, there are two types of logs. One is the error log and another one is access log. So if you don&#8217;t know when something is happening or what kind of are pages causing it in access log, you can see that. For example, in the last hour you got 1000 views of specific page on the website that has a newsletter and some feed or something and then you can assume that something on that page is creating a problem and continue from there. In that case you can create test page with only one block or with only feed to see if that is going to behave slowly and then you can eliminate one by one. This is if the page is making a problem. Then you can see also if there is some current jobs or W-P-C-L-I commands and then you can address those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in multiple cases if you have a big database doing a backup, it can slow down the site because the database will be locked and then the site cannot do anything. So again, you can move backups, but you can see those details in the access login error log of the website. Again you cannot see everything there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-using-more-advanced-tools\">Using More Advanced Tools</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to go more advanced and I want to be actively doing on performance, there are tools that I would recommend that you can use New Relic, you can use Xdebug or you can use Blackfire. All those three tools are testing your code performance. You can record the whole page and then it&#8217;ll tell you exactly how many queries, what function is called, how many times the function is called, which file is, and how it&#8217;s behaving in the background for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there you can then pick saying, okay, this plugin is taking five seconds to load on this specific page to I really need this plugin or can this be changed? Can I introduce some caching plugin, can I? But those are a little bit more advanced tools but I would spend some time to get familiar with those similar tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just once more, this is Blackfire, New Relic and Xdebug. Some of them are free, some of them have a paid plan. So again, you don&#8217;t need all three but you can start with at least one. And then again, if you want to test the front end and just the Google Page speed, you can use Lighthouse or Google speed may have some suggestion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To sum it up, first one is query monitor, easy, and there are good things about it. It&#8217;s pretty user friendly. You can just see what&#8217;s happening and if something is red, you know that strong. So it&#8217;s easy to find the bottlenecks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one would be check the logs on the server, both access and error logs and then PHP errors or something like that.And the third one is use one of the tools like Blackfire, New Relic or Xdebug and again you&#8217;ll find issues with plugins but then this is awareness I&#8217;m talking about. But yes, what would your steps be?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-sabrina-s-perspective-as-a-performance-engineer\">Sabrina&#8217;s perspective as a performance engineer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I will share the steps when I&#8217;m hired to work on a websites, but steps that someone who is not performance expert but just a developer can take to identify what&#8217;s happening and if something is happening because this is the beginning of the process. So let&#8217;s say you just notice something is off. I would recommend to start with narrowing down the problem if it might be overwhelming for the person who is not used to a lot of performance information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-google-search-console\">Google search console</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I would recommend to first identify if the problem exists and if so where it does exist. I would recommend to go first thing to Google search console and check your core web vitals data and see if there are any issues there. Google Search console is place where in page size there is a small thing where you have core web vitals assessment. This is real field data from your website, but it comes from the bigger source of information and the more detailed report can be found in Google search console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a tab there called core vitals. You can go there and check if your website is passing core vitals assessment. If the website is passing core web vitals assessment, especially on LCP and first input delay, which will soon be replaced with INP interactive to the next paint. So if it passing on this two, it means that real users don&#8217;t have problems with speed on your website on front end, but if at the same time you have the feeling that something is off, something is loading slowly, I would try to differentiate probably if it&#8217;s happening only when you locked in, if it&#8217;s happening for locked in users and it&#8217;s not happening for locked out users and then you will have the answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it&#8217;s not happening for locked out users, there are no issues with core web vitals, then this issue most likely will be connected with something on backend that is cached or mitigated by something on front end for locked off users. Okay, this is already a lot of information for us. We already know that we should be looking in the backend because it&#8217;s happening in the backend and from this point I would recommend install query, monitor and looking there. But again, when you install query monitor, there is a huge amount of information there. If you don&#8217;t know where you are looking at, it&#8217;s easy to get lost. And some websites have a lot of issues. This happens to my clients a lot. They see that the website have a lot of issues, there are errors, there are slow queries, there are a lot of sales and scripts loading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many issues I would recommend to pinpoint what is the most easy thing to fix and the most easy things to fix are usually basic ones, First it&#8217;s PHP version. It would be so easy to, it&#8217;s really, really easy to fix. You just upgrade server to a higher PHP version test there. If all plugins play well with it, you keep it going.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-memory-limits\">Memory limits</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the thing that is often overlooked, there is a theme that we have in WordPress that is called Ability memory limit and by default it&#8217;s set to 40 megabytes and I see a lot of cases when this default number hasn&#8217;t been changed. For years the site was surviving somehow, but now it&#8217;s not because 40 megabytes, it&#8217;s very, very low number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it happens often. I see that they are upgrading their hosting, they&#8217;re paying for say two gigabytes of RAM on their hosting, but there is a limit set in their WordPress to 40 gigabytes. So they never use what they&#8217;re paying for. By the way query monitor is showing that thing. So if memory limit is set to the default to 40 megabytes, you&#8217;ll see that in query monitor. That would be another very easiest thing to fix. This is something that you should be able to fix yourself and if after that the problem doesn&#8217;t disappear, that that is a sign there is a problem that this is a sign you should seek for help.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-misleading-object-caching\">Misleading object caching</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Object caching can be a very good idea and query monitor might be showing that as well. What it shows you sometimes can be misleading. In query monitor it says object caching plugin is not in use and it&#8217;s a little bit misleading because you should check numbers next to this line seeing so many hits and so many cached and if you have from 100%, you have 95% cashed, that&#8217;s fine. It means query caching is working. It&#8217;s just you&#8217;re not using the plugin to manage it, but it is working. There is nothing to worry about. So my recommendation would be try to figure out if it&#8217;s frontend or backend by going to core web vitals. Then going as locked in user and trying to figure out if it&#8217;s backend or frontend. If it&#8217;s backend, it&#8217;s still query monitor, look at query basic things like WP memory limits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can listen to the entire episode <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-performance-optimization/\">WooCommerce Performance Optimization with Sabrina Zeidan and Uros Tasic</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"Do The Woo Community: Navigating High-Traffic Events with WooCommerce as an Agency\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=6082\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://dothewoo.io/navigating-high-traffic-events-with-woocommerce-as-an-agency/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4090:\"<p>Operating a large-scale e-commerce business is no small feat, but when Black Friday through Cyber Monday hits, the challenges intensify, making it a crucial period for businesses like Maksimer.

These systems trigger alerts when server resources approach their limits, enabling quick intervention to prevent site crashes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-navigating-the-unknown\">Navigating the Unknown</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the conversation it turns  to the unpredictable nature of server warnings, comparing them to a tsunami warning with a narrow window for response. Despite the challenges, having different departments within the company, such as the growth department and eco managers, provides additional support. Eco managers work closely with clients, offering insights and suggestions for handling their websites during high-traffic events.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-entrepreneurial-mindset\">The Entrepreneurial Mindset</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>They talk about the unique mindset of e-commerce store owners, describing them as self-motivated individuals eager to explore new tools and strategies. The challenge lies in balancing their entrepreneurial spirit with practical considerations. The team at Maksimer often receives requests to implement new features, such as affiliate programs, based on success stories from other store owners. Adapting these requests to the specific e-commerce platform and ensuring compatibility becomes an integral part of the collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-building-partnerships\">Building Partnerships</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An important piece is the partnership dynamic between an agency and store owners in the e-commerce space. Unlike traditional marketing site builds, e-commerce clients actively engage throughout the entire process, understanding that their website directly influences their income stream. The agency&#8217;s role extends beyond building websites; they effectively control the client&#8217;s income funnel, requiring a collaborative and responsive approach to maintain client satisfaction, especially in crisis situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>High-traffic events in e-commerce demands a combination of meticulous planning, effective communication, and adaptability. The insights shared by the team at Maksimer shed light on the complexities of e-commerce operations and the vital role played by agencies in ensuring a seamless and successful online retail experience, even in the face of unforeseen challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/database-optimization-monitoring-tools-and-client-communication\">You can listen to the full podcast episode, Database Optimization, Monitoring Tools, and Client Communication with Nenad Conić here.</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"Do The Woo Community: A Deep Dive into the WordPress and WooCommerce Ecosystem’s Growth Strategies\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=6115\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://dothewoo.io/a-deep-dive-into-the-wordpress-and-woocommerce-ecosystems-growth-strategies/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9052:\"<p>In the online business world, WordPress and WooCommerce stand tall as two popular platforms that help businesses flourish. But to truly scale and excel, businesses need more than just the knowledge of these platforms—they need a well-thought-out plan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post dives deep into the growth strategies that can be implemented within the WordPress and WooCommerce ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-understanding-the-wordpress-and-woocommerce-ecosystem\"><strong>Understanding the WordPress and WooCommerce Ecosystem</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress and WooCommerce ecosystem is vibrant, involving a wide array of stakeholders that contribute to its rich diversity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, this ecosystem includes theme and plugin providers, developers, and hosting providers. These entities work hand in hand, each playing a vital role in creating an enabling environment for businesses to thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme and plugin providers, for instance, offer essential tools that enhance the functionality and aesthetic appeal of WordPress sites, ensuring users enjoy a seamless experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woo-dev-chat/\">Developers, on the other hand, bring in technical expertise</a>, customizing websites to meet specific business needs, while hosting providers offer the requisite infrastructure, ensuring websites are accessible, reliable, and fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpress-and-its-market-dominance\"><strong>WordPress and Its Market Dominance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An understanding of the WordPress and WooCommerce ecosystem wouldn&#8217;t be complete without appreciating WordPress&#8217;s market dominance. WordPress holds sway over a significant portion of the CMS market, powering <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress\">over 40% of all websites</a> currently available on the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The factors driving its widespread adoption are its flexibility, ease of use, and extensive customization possibilities. <strong>WordPress&#8217;s open-source nature</strong>, combined with its vast community of developers and theme and plugin providers, provides businesses with virtually unlimited potential for customizability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s this scalability and versatility that have contributed significantly to WordPress&#8217;s sustained market dominance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-woocommerce-and-its-place-in-ecommerce\"><strong>WooCommerce and Its Place in eCommerce</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce is a dynamic player in the global eCommerce market. It rides on WordPress&#8217;s success by providing an intuitive, flexible, and powerful ecommerce platform that businesses of all sizes can leverage to set up online stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of WooCommerce are immense. From its seamless integration with WordPress, ease of use, flexibility, and the availability of numerous themes and plugins, WooCommerce offers businesses a customizable platform for setting up online stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When stacked against other platforms like Shopify, Magento, and BigCommerce, WooCommerce shines for its affordability and adaptability. Shopify and BigCommerce are monthly subscription-based platforms, while Magento can be complex and may require expert developer knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the contrary, WooCommerce is free, open-source, and user-friendly, making it a viable contender in the eCommerce space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-identifying-opportunities-for-growth\"><strong>Identifying Opportunities for Growth</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the dynamic WordPress and WooCommerce ecosystem, businesses must continuously identify and seize growth opportunities. A successful scaling strategy involves playing to the platform&#8217;s strengths and seeing beyond immediate needs to include future prospects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are growth opportunities that businesses can use:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-expanding-product-offerings\"><strong>1. Expanding Product Offerings</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In any business venture, innovation is key. To truly tap into the potential of WooCommerce and WordPress, consider expanding your product offerings. This could be done by developing new plugins or incorporating additional services that complement your current product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples could include tools that enhance website functionality, services geared towards improving the user-experience, or partnerships aimed at promoting your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-building-strong-partnerships\"><strong>2. Building Strong Partnerships</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind every successful business, there&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/the-enigma-of-wordpress-and-woocommerce-partnerships/\">network of strong partnership</a>s. In the WordPress and WooCommerce ecosystem, fruitful connections can be forged with plugin and theme providers, WordPress agencies, and hosting providers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaborating with these entities on various initiatives can lead to reciprocal benefits and expanded growth opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-focusing-on-customer-success-and-support\"><strong>3. Focusing on Customer Success and Support</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The backbone of every successful business is its loyal customers. By building a robust customer support system, you&#8217;ll foster trust, loyalty, and eventual advocacy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prioritize customer success management, which involves understanding your customers&#8217; journey and providing the support they need at every step.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-investing-in-content-marketing-and-seo\"><strong>4. Investing in Content Marketing and SEO</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret sauce for <a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/influencer-marketing/\">gaining visibility and attracting customers</a> lies in content marketing and SEO.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating valuable, engaging, and <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/future-seo-content-ai/\">SEO-friendly content</a> ensures your business&#8217; visibility to potential customers and argues for your credibility within your industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-adapting-to-industry-trends\"><strong>5. Adapting to Industry Trends</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In today&#8217;s rapidly changing digital world, staying informed about industry trends and adapting your strategies accordingly, can be a game-changer for your business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular monitoring of industry best practices, competitor activity, and <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/tag/emerging-technologies/\">emerging technology</a> trends can keep you on your toes and ready to adapt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-measuring-the-success-of-growth-strategies\"><strong>Measuring the Success of Growth Strategies</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing growth strategies without a system to measure their success won&#8217;t yield the desired effect. Analytics play a vital role in gauging the effectiveness of strategies and indicate where improvements are needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-metrics-to-nbsp-track\"><strong>Metrics to&nbsp; Track</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To quantify your strategy&#8217;s success, consider tracking metrics like customer acquisition costs, churn rate, and average revenue per user.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These metrics provide insight into how effectively your strategies are working, where improvements could be made, and whether you&#8217;re reaching your desired goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-adjusting-strategies-based-on-data\"><strong>Adjusting Strategies Based on Data</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Data is your best ally when it comes to steering the direction of your growth strategies. It adds objectivity to the process, helps you steer clear of bias-based decisions and allows for strategic pivots based on insights drawn from real-life performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuous analysis and refinement of your strategies based on <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-custom-order-tables-databases-and-performance/\">performance data</a> will help ensure that your growth strategies remain effective and relevant in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-words\"><strong>Final Words</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress and WooCommerce platforms are excellent tools for online business growth. However, simply knowing how to use these tools isn&#8217;t enough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To truly succeed, businesses must have a solid plan. This should involve identifying new opportunities, building partnerships, focusing on customer service, staying updated with industry trends, and making data-driven decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining these strategies ensure success not only today but also prepares businesses for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-theme-palette-5-background-color has-background has-medium-font-size\"><strong>This is a guest post from our sponsor and the team at <a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/\">Dotstore</a></strong></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"Do The Woo Community: Documentation is a Gift to the WordPress Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=6007\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://dothewoo.io/documentation-is-a-gift-to-the-wordpress-community/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1370:\"<p>While we we were recording an episode of <strong><em>The WordPress Way</em></strong> at Do the Woo about <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/importance-of-product-testing-in-wordpress/\"><strong>The Importance of Product Testing in WordPress</strong></a>, guest Brian Alexander did a quick note in the chat tool we use during a recording, simply saying, &#8220;Documentation is a gift to the community.&#8221; Host Abha Thakor asked him to elaborate on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian</strong>: Yeah, consider someone who is not as familiar with WordPress or is having a problem with their website or is a developer who&#8217;s just getting started. All of those different roles benefit from having strong updated documentation. Think of how many forum posts might not have been logged because it was clearly stated how to use a particular feature in the documentation or perhaps uncovering bugs as you said, because that&#8217;s all part of it. Validating your documentation in a way you&#8217;re testing what your assumptions are and if those assumptions are incorrect, then you&#8217;re assuming the wrong thing or there&#8217;s a bug in the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that definitely becomes a gift to the entire community as a resource that doesn&#8217;t require one-on-one time or tying up one person.

You talked about schema. What&#8217;s that pace of change like now compared to how it has been over the last say, 20 years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Alex replied.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would say it seems that since September, Google have woken up to updating a lot more stuff. from what I heard, Google was busy with other things internally that that was prioritized over supporting schema within search console and different elements of it. But I saw when things like the FAQ and the event snippets were removed from the SERPs, there&#8217;s been a lot of testing over time of what different elements should be output in the search results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at the same time, you&#8217;ve got their own AI integrations with their own SERP. So there&#8217;s been a lot of changes, not only, I would say more clarification and expansion into what they&#8217;ve already been telling us the entire 20 years. So 20 years ago they had the webmaster guidelines, it was quite basic, right? But now it&#8217;s a whole documentation area of the site. everything&#8217;s been done.

So I did support for a long time before I hired somebody to help me with it, and now we&#8217;re kind of splitting the workload and I still go in there from time to time just to see what are the really technical tickets or if I know a customer, I will reply to them just to maintain that relationship or if I feel like I can get some more information out of the issue that the customer has or what they might want next for the plugin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll also jump in and reply. So I keep doing a lot of support and since I develop my own plugins, it&#8217;s always going to be the fastest. I can do probably 20 tickets in an hour and they will be finished too. There will be a reply.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-using-support-to-perfect-documentation\">Using support to perfect documentation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s really the best thing to do for me. But yeah, it takes a lot of time, so you want to have to put in that time. But other than that, what I also did is I keep perfecting documentation, so I keep going back to the same documentation. If a customer has a question that is in the documentation and they didn&#8217;t find a reply, I will rewrite it. I will find a different way to say the same thing. And now I&#8217;m also experimenting with AI just to see if it can help with lowering that burden on support and also just give a quicker answer to my customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-average-ticket-when-you-delegate-support-might-take-half-an-hour-to-do\">The average ticket when you delegate support might take half an hour to do</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katie</strong>: It&#8217;s interesting what you say about being able to do 20 tickets an hour because that highlights the most difficult thing that I have found in outsourcing your support and getting help with it because I too, as the founder, very, very fast at responding to tickets at what I think is very high quality. I know the product so well, I know our documentation, I wrote it after all. And so I can provide good responses very quickly, but then as soon as you start hiring out people to do it, whether they&#8217;re in-house or not, you find that that&#8217;s not what you receive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, and I&#8217;ve talked to many other WordPress product companies, the average ticket when you delegate support might take half an hour to do. They&#8217;re not doing 20 tickets an hour or anything like that. And as a founder, that&#8217;s really frustrating because you don&#8217;t understand why they&#8217;re not as fast as you, but you kind of have to just learn to accept that it&#8217;s one of the inevitable consequences of growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, at Barn2, we handle 22,000 support tickets last year. So clearly I can&#8217;t do all the support myself, and I would love to, I really enjoy support, particularly pre-sales because it&#8217;s an excellent touchpoint with your customers where you can really learn their motivation, how they see your products, and constantly when I do step into support and talk to customers, I&#8217;m finding opportunities to improve the documentation, improve the products, improve our sales pages. I learned so much from doing the support, but it&#8217;s not realistic. And so you have to get help and as part of that, you just have to accept that nobody is as fast as you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-i-still-go-in-there-and-i-do-a-lot-of-support\">I still go in there and I do a lot of support</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maarten</strong>: Yeah, and I was going to add that I fully agree with you there. It&#8217;s very frustrating in the beginning to find a support agent because you are used to your own speed of doing things, and it&#8217;s like you said, you have to come to terms with it. And for me, it took like six months where I was very frustrated with how things were going, and then I realized that it&#8217;s just all in my head and my expectations need to be different, and now everything&#8217;s going well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m very happy with the support guide and it&#8217;s all known off my shoulders, so it&#8217;s perfect really. But I still go in there and I do a lot of support, but it&#8217;s on my agenda to lower my burden on support for this year because I&#8217;m doing too much and I&#8217;m spread a little bit too thin, especially if I&#8217;m developing new plugins. So I&#8217;m going to have to let it go this year and do less support</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"Do The Woo Community: Why Malware Scanner Plugins Do Not Work on WordPress Sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=5258\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://dothewoo.io/why-malware-scanner-plugins-do-not-work-on-wordpress-sites/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7383:\"<p><strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/security-from-the-basics-to-enterprise-with-calvin-alkan/\">In a episode on Do the Woo, we had Calvin Alkin chatting with hosts Carl and Kathy.</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kathy asked Calvin this question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calvin, I want to get back to why the plugin is, why that whole model doesn&#8217;t really work. Because of how PHP works. There might be some non-technical people who might not understand exactly how that model doesn&#8217;t work, and they might not be able to find time to read your research. But can you just give an overview of why that doesn&#8217;t,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happens, I mean, I&#8217;ve seen the malware that&#8217;s done this, that&#8217;s like, oh, well, you can find everybody else&#8217;s malware, but you&#8217;re not going to find mine. And that hacker can modify those files. Can you explain why they can, why they get a site has an intrusion from, let&#8217;s say a SQL vulnerability, that SQL injection that does not have anything to do with anything happening in PHP, but they can still then get access to PHP files and modify them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-scanner-plugins-won-t-work\">Why scanner plugins won&#8217;t work</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s start by at the point of through some means your site has been infected, so it doesn&#8217;t matter that infinite attack vectors, how that could have happened, but now your site has malware on it, and you also have a plugin that does malware scanning, maybe like using the WP chron periodically, or you can start it from the UI, whatever. But ultimately this scan, the malware scan runs in the same process, the PHP process and with the same privilege level as the malware. So the most simplest and the most blunt hit with the hammer approach, the malware could just simply disable or delete your security plugin from the file system. This will be like the easiest to understand the first time the malware runs, it just deletes your security plugin. That&#8217;s the easiest after there aren&#8217;t any scans, but obviously you as a site administrator would realize that at some point, yeah, maybe not immediately, but maybe you&#8217;ll realize eventually that your security plugin is gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />So what they do is then because they can read the source code of the plugin, they can see how it works, and since they&#8217;re operating at the same privilege level, they&#8217;re both running inside of WordPress in the PHP process that powers WordPress, they can then alter the malware scanner in a way that maybe imagine this. They&#8217;re very complex operations going on to determine if a file is malware or not, and then the actual malware modifies that final result. It is displayed to you in the UI and just says, yeah, you&#8217;re all clean. Pretty much that&#8217;s how it works. They make the malware scanner lie to you. They make the malware scanner tell you there&#8217;s no malware, but there actually is. And the way to do that depends on malware based on the malware scanner that you have. And obviously we didn&#8217;t disclose what we did there. We don&#8217;t want to make it easier for folks, but it&#8217;s pretty easy, to be honest, like 10 lines of quote maybe to do that. It&#8217;s not hard. So yeah, that&#8217;s the fundamental issue. The system that is potentially infected wants to monitor itself, and that doesn&#8217;t work. It has to be from somewhere higher up or someplace that is more privileged at the server level.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-plugins-that-have-firewalls-associated-built-into-the-plugin\">Plugins that have firewalls associated built into the plugin</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So the firewall would be protection, not scanning. I mean, if you have hardware on your side, the firewall can be disabled in the very same manner. That&#8217;s also the, but at that point, you&#8217;re already infected. The firewall usually is there to prevent you from getting infected in the first place. There isn&#8217;t anything wrong in particular with plugin based firewalls. It&#8217;s more so that everything that you can do in a plugin with a firewall, you can do, for example, the Edge at CloudFlare or in the Nix firewall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />Yeah, just it&#8217;s heavy from a CIS admin perspective, especially in enterprise, right? We&#8217;re talking enterprise. So larger WooCommerce stores, larger sites, they need more PHP workers. They want their code to be more efficient so that the response time is faster and all those things. If every request has to be processed as a firewall request, it&#8217;s a lot of processing time dedicated to that. It&#8217;s not. Trivial in itself is a one serious reason to just not use super heavy security plugins like that is if they just do a lot and they put a lot of weight on your WordPress installation, which is a problem again for enterprise because they&#8217;re trying to be more performant, they&#8217;re trying to handle more sales, more everything, and you&#8217;re basically, it&#8217;s like having an ankle weight. You&#8217;re kind of dragging. Every request has this huge ankle weight that you&#8217;re dragging, and that serves not no purpose, but as we&#8217;re discussing the malware scanning doesn&#8217;t work. It&#8217;s more like security theater, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />The malware scanning and some other things. Fundamentally, it&#8217;s impossible to perform that at the plugin level. And there are other things that are the same, but for example, the firewall, it is absolutely possible to write a secure firewall in a WebPress plugin. There&#8217;s nothing that makes it conceptually impossible, unlike the malware example. You can do that, whether the existing ones are secure, it&#8217;s a different topic, but it is theoretically possible. The thing is, it will not be performed because as Carl mentioned, at that point where the plugin based firewall runs, you already incur the majority of the cost of that request. You already went through the edge layer. Engine X ran, WordPress was booted, and then your firewall is hit. So it&#8217;s not performant. It&#8217;s possible to do it securely,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br />Or let&#8217;s go one step further to you&#8217;re trying to mitigate a DDoS. If your firewall&#8217;s, the actual PHP application, you ain&#8217;t mitigating anything, right? Your site&#8217;s blowing up either way. It&#8217;s all cool. You have a firewall, but you&#8217;re still getting hammered by hundreds of thousands of requests, your server&#8217;s not going to be able to handle it, and it&#8217;s not really designed for that either. You can do it on the same machine. I&#8217;ve done work with people that nonprofits where they can&#8217;t use American companies for security reasons, and so they can&#8217;t use CloudFlare or things like that. So you have to do a lot of the protection yourself at the machine level, but it&#8217;s not, you want those requests to be blocked. You can even overwhelm a Linux machine if you&#8217;re not careful, even with a DDoS. So that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s not efficient either, right? Part of the goal of a firewall is to prevent those DDoS attacks, and you basically are not doing that with a PV based firewall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/security-from-the-basics-to-enterprise-with-calvin-alkan/\">You can listen to the full episode here</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"Do The Woo Community: Headless WooCommerce: Pros, Cons, and When to Use It\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=5911\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://dothewoo.io/headless-woocommerce-pros-cons-and-when-to-use-it/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7873:\"<p>Headless WooCommerce is a modern approach to ecommerce websites, where the frontend (the part that users see and interact with) is separated from the backend (the part that processes data and business logic).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This separation allows developers to create custom, high-performing stores and gives them more control over the user experience. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the key to enabling communication between the frontend and backend in this headless architecture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In traditional WooCommerce websites, the frontend and backend are tightly coupled, limiting flexibility and potentially impacting performance. With Headless WooCommerce, developers can harness the power of decoupled architecture to create lightning-fast websites that are more adaptable to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-headless-woocommerce-works\"><strong>How Headless WooCommerce Works?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bobwp.com/defining-headless-with-woocommerce-and-wordpress/\">Headless WooCommerce</a> relies on a decoupled architecture, meaning that the frontend and backend operate independently from one another. This separation allows each layer to be developed and maintained independently, while still communicating effectively through APIs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/\">REST API</a> or <a href=\"https://graphql.org\">GraphQL</a> plays a crucial role in exchanging data between the two layers, enabling them to work together seamlessly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When creating a custom frontend for Headless WooCommerce, developers can choose from various JavaScript frameworks such as <a href=\"https://react.dev/\">React</a>, <a href=\"https://angular.io/\">Angular</a>, or <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue</a>. These frameworks provide the tools needed to build interactive, high-performance user interfaces while capitalizing on WooCommerce&#8217;s robust backend infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-benefits-of-headless-woocommerce\"><strong>Benefits of Headless WooCommerce</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several major advantages to implementing Headless WooCommerce, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Improved performance and website speed</strong>: Separating the frontend and backend allows for optimization of each layer, leading to faster load times and an overall better user experience.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More freedom for frontend developers</strong>: With a decoupled architecture, frontend developers can build custom layouts, designs, and interactivity without worrying about conflicts or limitations from the backend.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Better integration capabilities</strong>: APIs make it easier to integrate other services and applications into your ecommerce platform, streamlining business processes and customer interactions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enhanced security</strong>: Separating the frontend and backend can create an additional layer of security, as potential vulnerabilities in one layer might not directly impact the other.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: A headless setup supports the growth of your ecommerce business by allowing you to easily scale and adapt the frontend and backend independently.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-drawbacks-of-headless-woocommerce\"><strong>Drawbacks of Headless WooCommerce</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its advantages, there are potential disadvantages of opting for a Headless WooCommerce setup, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Complexity in development and maintenance</strong>: Building and maintaining separate frontend and backend systems can require a higher level of technical knowledge and expertise, increasing the complexity of projects.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Limited access to certain plugins and tools</strong>: Some <a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/woocommerce-plugins/\">WooCommerce plugins and tools</a> might not be compatible with a headless setup, which may affect your choice of extensions and features.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cost factors related to development and hosting</strong>: Customizing and hosting separate systems may increase costs compared to traditional WooCommerce implementations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Steeper learning curve</strong>: Developers might need to learn new technologies, frameworks, or architectures to effectively work with Headless WooCommerce.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Possibility of creating disjointed experiences</strong>: If the frontend and backend aren&#8217;t well-integrated, it can lead to dissonance or inconsistencies in the user experience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-when-to-use-headless-woocommerce\"><strong>When to Use Headless WooCommerce?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Headless WooCommerce may not be suitable for all ecommerce stores, but it can yield significant benefits in specific situations. If your business is based on unique user experiences or needs custom interactivity that can&#8217;t be achieved with traditional themes, Headless WooCommerce could be the answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses that require high scalability and flexibility are more likely to benefit from the separation of frontend and backend.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, those who need to integrate their stores with external systems, such as <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/erp/what-is-erp/\">ERP systems</a> or specialized CRM software, might find Headless WooCommerce more accommodating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it&#8217;s important to remember that implementing Headless WooCommerce does require more development resources and skills. Be sure you have the team and budget to handle the increased complexity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-alternatives-to-headless-woocommerce\"><strong>Alternatives to Headless WooCommerce</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all businesses are equipped or need to implement a headless approach. For those who find the concept excessive or unfit for their requirements, there are alternatives available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Managed WordPress hosting solutions, for instance, provide an easier way for you to maintain your WooCommerce store. They handle technical aspects like security, backups, and updates, so you can focus on your business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, if WooCommerce doesn&#8217;t meet your needs, there are plenty of other ecommerce platforms available. Shopify, Magento, and BigCommerce each have their own distinct advantages and could be worth considering. Though they might not offer the same degree of customization and flexibility as WooCommerce, they may fit your clients needs better.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-words\"><strong>Final Words!</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Headless WooCommerce presents ecommerce businesses with the chance to maximize the potential of their platforms, enabling them to create unique user experiences, optimize performance, and enhance security among others. However, the complexity of the architecture, a steeper learning curve, and potentially higher costs serve as potential challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to adopt this approach will heavily depend on your business type, resources, budget, and specific needs. Those who can meet the demands of a headless architecture can truly unlock powerful possibilities for their ecommerce store. As always, it&#8217;s vital to consider all alternatives to ensure finding the best fit for your ecommerce venture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, the aim is to provide the best experience for your customers, and the choice of platform should align with this objective.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column5911_f4b5d1-72\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<p class=\"has-theme-palette-5-background-color has-background has-medium-font-size\">This is a guest post from the team at <a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/\">Dotstore</a></p>\n</div></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"Do The Woo Community: 10 Tips on Why You Need to Do a Marketing Post Mortem with Your Black Friday Sales\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=5842\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"https://dothewoo.io/10-tips-on-why-you-need-to-do-a-marketing-post-mortem-with-your-black-friday-sales/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4064:\"<p>In a podcast episode on Do the Woo. hosts Adam and Emma walked listeners through the importance of doing a marketing post-mortem after your Black Friday sales. Though you may feel Black Friday is done and gone, best to revisit this to be prepared for the next time you do a huge sale on your WordPress products or services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>1. Schedule a time as soon as possible.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it might be tempting to wait until the rush of orders and customer service inquiries subsides, conducting a post-mortem as soon as possible allows you to capture fresh insights while memories are still vivid. Aim for a time when things have settled but not too long after the event so that the data is still relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>2. Identify your goals and objectives.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving into the numbers, clearly define your goals for Black Friday. Were you aiming to increase sales, reach a specific customer segment, or simply boost brand awareness? Having clear objectives will help you assess whether you achieved them and identify areas for improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>3. Gather and analyze data from various channels.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t limit your analysis to just your website traffic and sales figures. Examine data from email marketing, social media, paid advertising campaigns, and other marketing channels to get a comprehensive overview of your performance across all fronts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>4. Evaluate the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which marketing channels generated the most traffic and conversions? Which creative elements resonated best with your audience? Identify the campaigns that performed well and explore how you can replicate or enhance their strategies for future events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>5. Analyze product performance.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examine which products sold well and which ones fell short of expectations. Understanding why certain items were more popular than others can inform your product development, purchasing, and pricing decisions in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>6. Identify customer behavior trends.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyze customer purchase patterns, browsing behavior, and engagement metrics to gain insights into their shopping habits and preferences. This information can guide your marketing efforts and product offerings in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>7. Gather feedback from customers.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reach out to your customers via surveys, social media polls, or direct messages to gather their feedback on your Black Friday experience. Their insights can help you identify areas for improvement and enhance customer satisfaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>8. Document your findings and action plans.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create a detailed report summarizing your key findings, action plans, and recommendations. Share this report with your team to ensure everyone is on the same page and can contribute to implementing the improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>9. Use the insights to inform your future marketing strategies.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t let the post-mortem be a one-time exercise.

Personally, I have read several posts and even listened to some talks. I was kind of getting the concept, but let&#8217;s just say I couldn&#8217;t wrap my head around it. (No pun intended.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/headless-woocommerce-with-jacob-arriola/\">That was until we had Jacob Arriola on the podcast.</a></strong> And it finally made sense to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Headless is More Than the Legend of Sleepy Hollow</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll give you the way I understand it. Right? There&#8217;s a lot of different interpretations. We take WordPress and <strong>WooCommerce</strong> as an example that is a monolithic application, meaning it&#8217;s responsible for a lot of things. It&#8217;s your CMS, right? Your admins, your shop owners log in and add content, you&#8217;ve got media library, it&#8217;s got products, it&#8217;s got orders, et cetera. But it&#8217;s also responsible for serving the front end, the public facing side of your application. The product catalog page, the single product page, the cart page, <strong><a href=\"https://jacobarriola.com/post/hosted-woocommerce-checkout-headless-application\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">checkout</a></strong>, so on and so forth. So it&#8217;s doing a lot of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so when you talk about headless, the head really represents that view layer, that UI layer, that public facing layer. When we talk about what is headless, we kind of cut off the head or we decouple the UI, now WordPress, is no longer responsible for delivering the front end of the application. It&#8217;s only responsible for being the CMS, which it&#8217;s really, really good at, right? And then in the WooCommerce case, all the logic regarding ecommerce variations, orders, all that stuff, database facilitation, <strong><a href=\"https://jacobarriola.com/post/headless-woocommerce-stripe-checkout-graphql\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">payment gateways</a></strong>, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now you are now responsible for building UI in a different kind of context, whether that&#8217;s a different domain, a whole different framework, whatever the case may be, right? So we separate that out the head, the view layer, the UI, what&#8217;s publicly available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-diving-into-headless\">Diving into headless</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that clearly should give you a better idea if you had been confused before. Of course that is only the tip of the iceberg and you may want to listen to the podcast as Jacob takes even deeper into the world of headless and WoCommerce.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Do The Woo Community: Why Do They Call it Black Friday\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=5399\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://dothewoo.io/why-do-they-call-it-black-friday/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2420:\"<p>In all the hoopla around Black Friday, some people think they know why it&#8217;s called such. Or maybe they don&#8217;t. History is fascinating, and podcast host Adam Weeks gives us the story behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-black-friday-sounds-bad\">Black Friday sounds bad</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So Black Friday has a long history that has nothing to do with shopping. There was the term, black Friday was used in some bad things such as stock market crashes such as the plague, different issues. There was the day after Thanksgiving, people would often call in sick because they just wanted to take that Friday off as well. In modern history as a marketing term started about in the eighties and the notion was that essentially Black Friday was the day that retail stores actually started making a profit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you think back to your classes of finance or doing the books, when you do not make money, when you are losing money, it is red. When you are making money, it is black. So hence Black Friday, which is mostly true. It&#8217;s a little bit of a folklore of how true that is and I,m sure it is different for different retail outlets, but essentially that&#8217;s the idea is that this is the season when people start to make money.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-big-friday-didn-t-quite-work\">Big Friday didn&#8217;t quite work</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It was kind of a marketing thing. They started out wanting to call it Big Friday, but Big Friday didn&#8217;t stick and Black Friday is what we are left with and because of its success, we are now also adding Cyber Monday. Do you know why they call it Cyber Monday? Back in the day, people had slow internet connections at home. At home they would have something called a modem that would make, and then when someone would pick up the phone, you&#8217;d get kicked off of the internet. So surfing on the internet was stupid for many people at home. And what they remembered is that my employer pays a lot of money for a really good internet connection at work. So when I get to work on Monday, that&#8217;s when I&#8217;m going to start shopping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to also hear some tips around selling on Black Friday, like which works better?

That is what I am always looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My friend and colleague, <strong>Jonathan Wold</strong>, is instrumental in helping me get Do the Woo where it is at today. I could go on and on about Jonathan, but another trait I really value from him is his unique and powerful insights that he brings to the Woo and WordPress ecosystem. And recently I was revisiting a post from last year about the challenges founders face with product businesses being undervalued in the WordPress ecosystem, my ears perked up. It&#8217;s titled, <a href=\"https://jonathanwold.com/using-the-loop-to-grow-a-wordpress-product-company/\"><strong>Using the Loop To Grow a WordPress Product Company.</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The post resonated with me initially as it applies to my own partnerships and how I can help my partners get the most out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really felt Jonathan hit the nail on the head. With as many of these product companies who are struggling with growth, they can take his thoughts and actually step back with an approach that is more refined and strategic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I don&#8217;t want to give away the whole post, but I wanted to tease you with these three elements of what he calls the &#8220;loop&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-jonathan-s-blog\">From Jonathan&#8217;s blog</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a small part of the post:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-partnerships\">Partnerships</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Our ecosystem is warming up to the idea of growing through strategic partnerships. I spoke about it at WordCamp Europe and published a framework for strategic partnerships that’s served as a starting point for founders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within the context of our growth strategy, the idea is that you start with a partnership. Identify another business within the WordPress ecosystem aligned with the audience you’re serving and the problem you’re focused on solving and form a partnership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early on, you can’t know whether a partnership will work out or to what extent. Accordingly, it’s critical to focus on your..</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-first-win\">First Win</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Work with your new partner to identify a first win. Given our emphasis on customer centricity, the ideal first win is going to be helping a mutual customer succeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where I often see partnerships go wrong. They “partner up”, and wait around for wins to happen. Stay focused on the partnership until you have a win that has all involved succeeding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A first win is also a great way to gauge the quality of the partnership and decide how much further each of you are willing to invest.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-talk-about-it\">Talk About It</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the win and keep the customer in focus; it’s about them, not you. With the customer’s blessing, tell the story. Work with your partner to share the mutual win within your spheres of influence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking about the win and keeping the customer in focus gives you an opportunity to both anchor and continuously refine your positioning.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-loop\">The Loop</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course the loop is the part that is as simple as this, <em>rinse and repeat</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, as I said before, this was just a teaser as there is a lot more to the post that will be helpful to any product company looking to grow, whether it&#8217;s a product for WooCommerce or the bigger WordPress ecosystem.

Host Ronald Gijsel asked him, &#8220;How do you find out if somebody is the right fit into your culture? Is that something that you are very conscious on when you&#8217;re recruiting somebody?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-recruitment-into-a-culture-of-values\">Recruitment into a culture of values</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Between 2003 and 2013, I had another software company, and there we failed with five different products and made all the mistakes that you can do. That was a product company. So that&#8217;s why this time when we are approaching the new product, we did some research, we looked at positioning and the market and the needs that customers value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now coming back to the recruitment, we start by trying to attract the right people. WPRiders was just starting up when it was founded as a company. I wrote down the values that I would ideally have that would run our company. These were not only just some words but an explanation of values, what was my understanding of those values at that time, and how does somebody objectively know if a person lives up to the values or not?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we started hiring people, I would just add those values into the job ad because that would communicate to certain people that, hey, these guys are like this, this is their values. And throughout the years we had people telling us that they had created the resume just to apply to your job. I have never had to apply to a job, but something clicked and I wanted to just meet you guys. So this is the effect that you are getting when you are consciously sending those messages, almost like a subliminal message on a certain wavelength. And then during the interview there are questions designed to discuss examples of this or that value, for example, integrity, honesty. And every six months we do evaluate ourselves with a performance appraisal and look at the values again to make sure we allocate some resources and budget in order to support and to foster those values.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-reviews-are-done-for-team-members\">How reviews are done for team members</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the years we&#8217;ve designed a process for this. Actually, that&#8217;s one way that helped me convert myself from a freelancer, one-man show, into a team. Every time I would do a repetitive task, I would just write down a checklist, like a guideline, a procedure. And then I would run it based on that checklist just to make sure I&#8217;m not missing anything. Later on when new colleagues came in, they would just pick up on those checklists and would develop them further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, we are doing these reviews internally based on these processes that we&#8217;ve developed. And we have our director of operations who&#8217;s evaluating most of the people because they are in the operational department and I am still doing the performance appraisals for the other areas like sales and recruitment.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"Do The Woo Community: What Sets a Good Freelance Developer Apart From the Others\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=4763\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://dothewoo.io/what-sets-a-good-freelance-developer-apart-from-the-others/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3025:\"<p>Freelancing is not for the weak-hearted.

Ideally, those who are respectful, and they appreciate your work, and they return to you and you build a relationship with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What many developers have admired the most about the freelancing is the relationship that you can build with clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Freelancing Gives You the Ability to Communication with Clients</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the ability to communicate with clients, to express yourself, to even talk about technical stuff and not only the technical stuff. All of that together makes it much more sense to as a human being and as a system solver or provider, to work with clients than any other way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What sets a good freelancer apart is the ability to build relationships. It&#8217;s never about what that customer needs now or what that customer might need now, it&#8217;s about supplying them with what they need now in such a manner that they are always going to come back to you for it. You are their trusted partner in this journey that they are making with their website, and they will always come back to you. It&#8217;s about establishing those relationships in very solid manner. And it&#8217;s about the small things. It&#8217;s about saying, please, thank you, or remembering them on a holiday and saying, &#8220;Hey, happy holiday.&#8221; It&#8217;s the little things that make it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Hardest Part is the Soft Stuff, Not the Technical Stuff.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, what sets a really amazing freelancer apart from ones that tackle the hardest part, the soft skills. That&#8217;s the most difficult part to really tone down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technical stuff you can learn in a book. Saying it&#8217;s not hard I suppose is reductive. But you&#8217;re capable of learning it with ease, there&#8217;s a structure to it. The soft stuff is the harder piece of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This post was inspired by the conversation with <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woo-bizchat-with-christopher-churchill-and-marcel-schmitz/\">Christopher and Marcel</a>&nbsp;on the podcast.</strong></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"Do The Woo Community: Thoughts on Translating the WooCommerce Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=4967\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://dothewoo.io/thoughts-on-translating-the-woocommerce-plugin/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7179:\"<p>Last year on a <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/translation-community-sustainability-woocommerce\"><strong>podcast</strong></a> host <strong>Abha Thakor</strong> had a chat with three Woo builders as they shared their stories around translation, meetups and sustainability. It&#8217;s great to reflect on past conversations as we need to keep these important elements of WooCommerce moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-translating-woocommerce-as-a-plugin-into-your-local-language\">Translating WooCommerce as a plugin into your local language</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the WooCommerce plugin, there are thoughts around the importance of translating it into local languages. For example, Simon Kraft from Germany weighed in on this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He started by stating that WooCommerce is similar to WordPress and any WordPress plugins because people often find their way around English strengths since English is the default in WooCommerce and many other plugins. But in cases like eCommerce, it&#8217;s very important to have that in your local language. This helps any user or developer to understand what you&#8217;re doing and find your way around a shop or a website. Luckily with WordPress there is a large community of volunteers pledging their time to translating enormous numbers of text to their local languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-translations-in-german\">Translations in German</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to Simon&#8217;s native language, German, he noted that they are a bit picky with having strange language strings in their websites and WooCommerce shops are no exception to that. Years ago when he started translating WooCommerce, he would find wrong or misleading translation, something that was translated with some automated software like Google Translate, but was not precisely on point in German. At that point he thought, &#8220;Hmm, we can do better than that.&#8221; So Simon moved over to the translation side of things and tried to fix it and not break stuff on my way there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-getting-started-on-translating-the-woocommerce-plugin\">Getting started on translating the WooCommerce plugin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vachan from India added how he started translating WooCommerce and how others can start. It started with his team and wanting to help the community. As a project translator the simplest way to do this is to go to the <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/\"><strong>translation page on the WordPress official website</strong></a>. There you will be able to easily find what interests you in translation. Just select your language and you can select which project you want to work on. For WooCommerce, once you have chosen your language, search for it. There you will find a complete front end system where you can see what has been translated and what is pending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In most cases, there are two primary places where you can help contribute to the translation. The first is the stable version, which is actually live and people are using it. Secondly, there&#8217;s a trunk, which is the future release, the immediate future release. Both are equally important because the current version helps whoever is already installed and working on that to ensure it gets updated whenever the user updates their website. And of course, the trunk is for the future release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He goes on to say that working in both is a good idea. It&#8217;s about your fluency and how comfortable you are picking up any language. If you feel you&#8217;re confident enough to take any language, you can explore it. See what words, which phrases are requiring any translation and you can suggest that translation. And it&#8217;s as simple as just filling up that simple clicking on the word, clicking on that phrase and just in inputting your translated reply. That&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-do-you-need-to-be-a-woocommerce-developer\">Do you need to be a WooCommerce developer?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Vachan does not feel you need to be a developer. You just need to understand WooCommerce enough and have used it. It&#8217;ll help you because you understand where that phrase is being used. Because in some languages, what happens with the same word could mean something differently, such as a different context. So just being aware of the context is a good thing. You don&#8217;t have to be an expert in development as there isn&#8217;t any coding language required. It&#8217;s just the language you know. And understanding the context of where that phrase is going to get used in the software is important.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-challenges-of-translation\">Challenges of translation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone on the podcast gave a bit of insight to the challenges not only met with WooCommerce translations, but WordPress as well. Maja gave one example of translating a certain term like <em>tab</em> or <em>field</em>. Once this is done and you translate to a new deposit, this word in the glossary. For instance, if the tab is being translated into my language, if you go and Google that word in my language, you will not find anything actually that explains how to solve your problem. So it would be great if there would be a visual supporting articles explaining this or expanding on the glossary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simon, when revisiting translating German, added that here are cases where stuff like that happens. In German, it&#8217;s not so bad because German and English are quite close to a certain degree. The main issue with German is that German words are very long in many cases. Because in German it&#8217;s grammatically sane to just chain words and have like <em>donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftsmützenfabrikant</em>. That&#8217;s a valid word. It&#8217;s about a hat for a sea captain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in many, many cases, it&#8217;s actually an issue to find a translation that fits the context. For example, you have a button somewhere and the button cannot be huge. So you have to find a fitting word that meets the context. That&#8217;s hard sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to WooCommerce or any eCommerce context, translating with localizing the currency is important. WooCommerce, which is America-focused in many cases, we have examples in U.S. Dollars and similar currencies, which is perfectly fine. But if we translated for the German or European market, then we would replace those examples with Euros or Pound or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The overall conversation carried a theme as first mentioned. It is important for WooCommerce builders, who have the resources and capabilities, to get involved with helping to translate the WooCommerce plugin. From what I have seen, the growth of Woo is building in countries across the world and here at Do the Woo we want to help you to bring your translating skills to help that growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, you can listen to or read the full transcript here of the episode <strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/translation-community-sustainability-woocommerce\">Stories of Translation, Community and Sustainability with Vachan, Maja and Simon</a></strong></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"Do The Woo Community: Breaking Into the WooCommerce Ecosystem as a Product Developer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=4747\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://dothewoo.io/breaking-into-the-woocommerce-ecosystem-as-a-product-developer/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2986:\"<p>If you are a product developer, you may be thinking of moving into the the Woo ecosystem. You may be starting a plugin or extension or have already built it. Maybe you are looking at a big player in the space to acquire it. Or reselling on the <strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-marketplace/\">WooCommerce marketplace.</a></strong> Here are three good places to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-make-your-product-compelling\">Make Your Product Compelling</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What is compelling about a product is when it&#8217;s really created with customer need in mind. Less breath, and more depth. By that have it focus on this one problem and just really introduce an elegant, simple, easy solution that reflects and understanding of the customer&#8217;s true need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has seen products out there, plugins, extensions, consumer products that are just patched together, modified from one thing to suit a different need. What is important is the thing that you&#8217;re creating really does meet a real need in the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-introduce-an-elegant-solution\">Introduce an Elegant Solution</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is looking at it from the customer perspective and not from a coding or development standpoint If the store owner uses your plugin , they want to with minimal guidance and to be able to feel confident in their use of it. That is the bigger picture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may not be feasible depending on the level of complexity of the problem that you&#8217;re trying to solve. But it can be bolstered by really great docs, videos, and how to&#8217;s. With Google these days, people can find guidance out there. If they are using something and it&#8217;s intuitive or it&#8217;s adapting to their skill level or needs, that is really beautiful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-winning-hearts-with-reviews\">Winning Hearts with Reviews</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not always about market share or numbers. It&#8217;s also about winning the hearts of those that you&#8217;re trying to serve. So the amount of passion that comes through reviews should reflect a love for a brand, or the story about &#8220;hey, it really made my work a lot easier,&#8221; or &#8220;It boosted my sales by 40 percent,&#8221; or, &#8220;it changed how I think about my business, and it changed the opportunity for me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just three examples that were shared with from <strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/a-roundtable-chat-with-clara-lee-product-marketing-at-woocommerce/\">Clara Lee who leads product marketing at WooCommerce.com</a></strong>.

Dave asked Dan about the speed of AI and shipping features out whether that be in the next month or the next week or the next year, and probably, at this rate, tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-long-term-short-term-long-term-test\">Long term, short term, long term test</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan shared when it comes to contemplating how to shape a feature, he has at least three major considerations. One is over the long term. Is there something foundational about this? Is there something fundamental about this? For example, they worked on this chat feature for Seth Godin&#8217;s blog and there&#8217;s a few other blogs it&#8217;s on too, and there there&#8217;s a lot of improvements of that coming down the pike. It was very much a first pass, but Dan believes that chatting with a blog, making it possible for someone to take any knowledge base, whether that&#8217;s something they&#8217;re curating or it&#8217;s a long tale of their blog history and making those recipes, those diary entries, those words of advice or whatever else that you filled your blog with accessible through a chat interface, he believes is a fundamental new both user interface paradigm and a much more powerful way to interact with content than we&#8217;ve had in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-every-site-owner-should-be-able-to-tune-for-their-own-use-case\">Every site owner should be able to tune for their own use case</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At Automattic, they believe that this is something that every site owner should be able to tune for their own use case. Much like with ChatGPT, how you can plug in tools, what does it look like to plug AI tools into a chat experience powered by a WordPress website? Dan thinks a lot of people are thinking about that and they&#8217;re thinking about that too. They just think there&#8217;s a huge amount of value. Is there something fundamental, is one question, and then are there many possible different use cases, all the way from a free site up to an enterprise site? Can we imagine that same feature, say chatting with a blog, being useful? Well, yes, if you provide customer support, if you provide advice, if you provide recipes, if you provide stories for kids, those are all different personalities and knowledge bases that can be delivered through exactly the same user interface paradigm and set of tooling. The adaptability of the GPT series of models means that we can use the same stuff to serve all those things, so that&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-does-it-solve-a-pain-point-people-have-today\">Does it solve a pain point people have today?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Then in the short term, the question is, and this is the third piece, does it solve a pain point people have today? Is there something missing in their lives? That part is a little harder. He feels like we are in a moment where people aren&#8217;t quite sure what this AI thing is for yet or how much to invest in it, but he does think that for many products, people are intrigued by AI and willing to try it as an add-on to something they already know. Oh, you were going to buy the pro plan. Oh, it comes with an AI thing. Well, you are definitely going to get it now and try it out for a week and whatever and see what that&#8217;s about because you want to know what AI can do for you and your business.&#8221; So we&#8217;re in a moment like that, that that&#8217;s kind of a bubble where I think that&#8217;s going to tip a lot of AI companies&#8217; conversions over the edge in the time being.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-are-you-actually-providing-value\">Are you actually providing value?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But the long-term test, the long-term tell is are you actually providing value? Do you actually have a moat? Can you be eaten alive by someone else with better data? He thinks at Automattic they have many, many, many possible things they can try that all of which look really, really promising and are based on, again, the reason why they invested in Sync is they asked the question, &#8220;Is it fundamental? Does it enable multiple potential use cases and does it scale from simple sites all the way to the enterprise?&#8221; And the answer for all three was yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/wordpress-woocommerce-ai/\">You can listen to the full show or read the transcript here.</a></strong></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"Do The Woo Community: What Storytelling Means to a WooCommerce Product Builder\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=4962\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://dothewoo.io/what-storytelling-means-to-a-woocommerce-product-builder/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7390:\"<p>Abha Thakor, co-host on my podcast <strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo</a></strong>, has been bringing on guests to tell stories since she joined our team.

Some corporate blurb that has nothing about the real person or people involved. <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woo-stories-they-are-everywhere/\"><strong>Storytelling</strong></a> has been around for thousands of years, the only difference is the tools that we use. A story, to be effective, has to have certain components to help people understand that story, to reach others, and for them to be moved or inspired by that story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that they should create stuff that&#8217;s not there. This is one of the things that I would really say to WooCommerce businesses, please don&#8217;t create stories that aren&#8217;t true. If you change people&#8217;s stories or what they share in reviews to fit your corporate brief or what you&#8217;re trying to sell, they will come back about it and they will not work with you again. They will also be a lost customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And actually, you don&#8217;t need to approach it like that because the story they&#8217;ve told you is the one which will inspire somebody else. Storytelling needs to be something that is positive, it needs to have an integrity to it. It also needs to avoid being translated into words that actually people will not understand. People don&#8217;t relate to that, people relate to people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-storytelling-means-to-a-product-builder\">What storytelling means to a product builder</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best stories are often going to be the people who write to you and give you a particularly strong review, saying why it made a difference. Now, don&#8217;t just use their review and run it as a promotion with all your branding around it. Talk to the person. Because talking to the person will give you more of the context of that story. That story itself is likely to be more powerful. You have empowered the person and the customer, you&#8217;ve made them feel valued, which is important because this customer has taken time to contact you. It is often so easy to give a negative review. In our culture, sadly, people will not jump to pay a compliment. Value that customer who does and help them share their story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Royal National Lifeboat Institution is a really good example. They are a charity in the UK and Ireland, and like many other organizations, they monitor what is happening. They monitor what is being said. But they don&#8217;t just take it, reproduce them and say, &#8220;Hey, this is all about us.&#8221; What they do is actually something that is the same for what you would do for a product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s, &#8220;Let&#8217;s talk to this person, let&#8217;s see what the context is. Let&#8217;s see what else they might want to say.&#8221; It may be that they want to share more. If you don&#8217;t have the conversation, you could have just missed out on the best story, something that will not only interest your audience, but will also motivate your team or staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stories can also come from other sources and interactions with your customers. Encourage your team to look out for how to help build your community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-story-brings-trust-for-newcomers-to-woocommerce\">The story brings trust for newcomers to WooCommerce</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We often say to one of the WooCommerce agencies we work with, &#8220;Okay, if you are working with a charity or you are sponsoring something because you passionately believe in it, what are you want to say about that?&#8221; And not from the perspective of making money off that charity or making money off that cause. But what is it that is part of your story? Because actually telling your story is more than telling the public that you sponsored something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve seen it with WooCommerce builders. I&#8217;ve dealt with a couple of sites recently that they&#8217;ve sent me. [These sites in their version of stories]&nbsp; literally talked about what they had in their toothpaste and when they brushed their teeth, what came out of their teeth. And &#8220;Why would people want to know this?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was because the teams looked at social media where people talked about breakfast and things like that. They didn&#8217;t know where to start, so, that&#8217;s what they did too. I have got permission to re-tell that story because the team there said, &#8220;Someone should have told us this.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s telling your story and telling what you are comfortable with sharing. I&#8217;m one of the editors of the People of WordPress series. And we&#8217;ve interviewed lots of people who are from e-commerce, but hear them say, &#8220;Okay, what are you happy to be reading about yourself? What are you going to be happy about someone talking to you about? Is really important and that&#8217;s for any person.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-it-s-about-being-listened-to-and-heard\">It&#8217;s about being listened to and heard</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s the joy for me, coming from a PR background where I&#8217;m a Chartered PR Practitioner and that&#8217;s a lot about actually thinking about the ethics of communication and how we deal with things in a positive way and how we involve people. We don&#8217;t do communications to them, we create or we do communications together because it&#8217;s about being listened to and being heard. And <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-builders-content-creation/\"><strong>helping people be listened to and heard is the greatest way to do that</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about ownership a lot. So if I was talking to you as a product developer, I would say, &#8220;Okay, share a little bit about what that means in terms of why it&#8217;s special to you, how and why it excites you,&#8221; because that is your story. And that may be what you invite other people to share as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, with the boats work that we do, we ask the captains to share what it is that they love about taking people on these wonderful excursions. And it becomes much more than this e-commerce thing that you&#8217;re supposed to do. It becomes a living and breathing part of your business and part of your organization. And that is when business really innovates, it&#8217;s when you get fantastic solutions, it&#8217;s where you meet and collaborate with other people. And more importantly, you get to meet exciting customers that makes day with you for the rest of your business career. And that&#8217;s the people that you want to be at your party when you retire. So, it&#8217;s bringing that locality back to you, really.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"Do The Woo Community: Looking at Code as Words\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=4770\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://dothewoo.io/looking-at-code-as-words/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2814:\"<p>During a past <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/cooking-up-some-code-with-kim-coleman/\"><strong>podcast Abha Thakor was chatting with Kim Coleman about her journey as a developer</strong></a>. Previously she had talked to her and one of the things that Kim liked about code, it is words and when you look at code, that is what you see. For those who are especially struggling or wanting to learn more she asked Kim to elaborate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-oh-this-is-code-i-can-t-understand-it\">Oh, this is code. I can&#8217;t understand it.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress itself in the early days and even to today, is largely built in a language called PHP. And it is a human readable language. If you get over the fact that you&#8217;re looking at code, it reads in English words that we all know and we can understand. But I think the hurdle is getting past looking at code and saying, &#8220;Oh, this is code. I can&#8217;t understand it.&#8221; You&#8217;re not looking at zeros and ones, you&#8217;re looking at words you can understand. For me, I got my start doing graphic design. I was creating print products, I was using Adobe tools to create them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And over time I started working more with my husband, Jason. He was my boyfriend at the time, building websites. He was studying computer science and he himself was more doing the backend in the code work. I was designing things as kind of a static mockup of the site and then I realized I could go a little farther, I could take another piece of this from his plate, I could do the actual HTML and CSS markup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, both languages that really are human readable languages. And then over time started doing some of the PHP work. I would call myself a front end developer at this stage, but it was really a granular process of using the resources I could find on the internet, using Stack Overflow, using what we called the WordPress codex at the time, now, the developer resource library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finding examples of code where people were extending WordPress, where people were adjusting the appearance of a theme, copying it, pasting it into my editor, reading the code and deciphering the code enough to say, &#8220;Oh, I just need to tweak this one little bit, this ID or this selector or this location to my term and then it will work.&#8221; So there&#8217;s a bit of a daring aspect to doing that. And it feels scary because you could potentially &#8220;break&#8221; something, but luckily we can undo things. Command Z, control Z often is your best friend when you are beginning to develop and not quite sure if you&#8217;re going to break something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/cooking-up-some-code-with-kim-coleman/\">You can listen to the full show or read the transcript here.</a></strong></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"Do The Woo Community: Multilingual Sites Are a Good Bet for WooCommerce Shops\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=4981\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://dothewoo.io/multilingual-sites-are-a-good-bet-for-woocommerce-shops/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5257:\"<p>No person is an island, and the same can be said for your WooCommerce store. In fact, you’ll want to make sure any potential customer can find you, regardless of the language they speak. If you run a multilingual WooCommerce store, you have the best chance of finding greater profits, and more success than ever before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are lots of ways to do this, but if you use WordPress and WooCommerce, you have a stellar foundation. Both are market-leading platforms, and if you extend the ecosystem using plugins, you can create almost any type of store imaginable. What’s more, you have enormous flexibility and power under the hood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this post, we’re going to take a look at a number of ideas and thoughts around why you should launch a multilingual WooCommerce store. To set some context, let’s talk about the popularity of WordPress and WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wordpress-market-share-and-how-woocommerce-leverages-it\">WordPress’ Market Share (And How WooCommerce Leverages It)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, WordPress is a huge industry. It is used for <strong>nearly 45 percent</strong> of all websites and sees constant growth. More users come to the platform on a regular basis, despite the competition. There are lots of positives to this, which we’ll discuss later on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for WooCommerce, the statistics still make for good reading and account for several million sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-e-commerce-statistics-correlate-with-wordpress-own-numbers\">How E-Commerce Statistics Correlate With WordPress’ Own Numbers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Worldwide e-commerce is also big business. Purchase numbers were around <strong>two billion across 2020</strong>, and with around 25 percent in growth of the market, it’s a channel that lots of stores should be a part of. The good news is that WordPress and WooCommerce can both scale to meet those demands and is continually growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, WooCommerce has core design and code to help you <strong>scale a store</strong>. This is just one of the many positives of using the platform in this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-benefits-of-running-a-multilingual-woocommerce-store\">The Benefits of Running a Multilingual WooCommerce Store</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are likely customers, ready and waiting, almost everywhere in the world. By extension, this means there may be demand for your products or services.&nbsp;This is the core benefit of running a multilingual WooCommerce store, but there are lots more to consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>User Experience (UX)</strong>. The UX of your site will improve because you will cater to the most number of users. A site in a familiar language is going to be easier to navigate, use, and interact with.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</strong>. Each extra page for your multilingual content will have a rank in search engines. At a base level, the greater number of pages you index, the more chance a user will click one.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&#8216;Social currency’.</strong> This aspect covers a number of areas. For example, your attempt to localize your site (a key aspect of running a multilingual WooCommerce store) will bolster trust in your customers. Also, you stand to earn more credibility, goodwill, and loyalty.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ahead of the competition</strong>. If your sales are going well in your original market there’s a strong chance your products will gain the same success elsewhere. Perhaps you have several competitors in your home market that aren’t as ready and willing to create a multilingual store, this sets you apart and puts you ahead of the competition when it comes to international conversion rates.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, a multilingual WooCommerce store can open up new markets, and give your products and services fresh attention from would-be customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-to-launch-a-multilingual-woocommerce-store\">How to Launch a Multilingual WooCommerce Store</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you’ll need some tools, services, and platforms in place before you begin to create a multilingual WooCommerce store:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Your site will need to run an up-to-date version of WordPress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>By extension, you’ll also want to run the latest version of the WooCommerce platform too.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You’ll need some way to translate your content, and display it for users.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Most WooCommerce sites will already have products in place and optimized text, which leaves the translation process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding new customers is tough. While there’s merit in trying to reduce that churn, you will also need a strategy to find fresh customers for your products and services. A multilingual WooCommerce store is a top-tier yet simple way to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The premise is that the more eyes there are on your store, the greater the chance of a purchase or conversion. However, to get here, you’ll want to run a multilingual WooCommerce store. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This is a guest post from our sponsor Weglot</em></strong></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 10:45:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"Do The Woo Community: Personalization, the Future of eCommerce and WooCommerce\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://bobwp.com/?p=4734\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://dothewoo.io/personalization-the-future-of-ecommerce-and-woocommerce/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3490:\"<p>In a<strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-agency-growth-and-the-power-of-subscriptions-with-kenn-kelly/\"> podcast with Kenn Kelly from Never Settle</a></strong>, a WooCommerce agency, he was asked  with all of the changes happening in the e-commerce industry, the different platforms, headless becoming a thing now,  where does he envision the future of e-commerce going? And how does Woo fit into that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kenn shared that subscription based businesses stood out to him. which we&#8217;ve been seeing happen for a long time. Amazon pressed that quite a few years ago. And a lot of people started realizing, it was like, &#8220;My toilet paper&#8217;s going to be on delivery.&#8221; And now everyone&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, this makes a lot of sense.&#8221; And people also see, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s a recurring revenue stream.&#8221; He thinks when it&#8217;s forced it doesn&#8217;t work. But he absolutely thinks that that segment of e-commerce is going to continue to really expand. And WooCommerce can do that out of the box, really powerful engine, there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that his agency sees where they get called into bigger projects are people wanting some sort of advanced subscriptions. So a client that Never Settle is launching right now, Bixbi Pet, they have all these incredible dog foods, and all organic, and all this stuff, and they&#8217;re in most PetSmarts across the country, and pretty large business. But their customers are on subscriptions for their dog food, and their dog treats, and cat food, and cat treats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they wanted a really cool checkout engine for people to build their subscription. So his agency had a lot of customization in that, but where they found the most customization, where he thinks it&#8217;d be fun to see us as a community invest more into WooCommerce is my account experience. That&#8217;s the thing that he feels like has the most potential, not just in design and user interface. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, for these guys, they want their customers to come in and be able to just swap out what flavors they&#8217;re in. So they&#8217;re going to order three bags a month and they want to be able to go in and change those without changing the subscription. And that&#8217;s highly custom. That&#8217;s not something that you can do out of the box, or to set up an auto-rotation where they&#8217;re just surprised. They can just say, &#8220;Hey, of these six flavors, just rotate them for me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so they built that for them. And Kenn thinks not only are you going to see subscription businesses increase, but you&#8217;re going to see people really pressing into the customer experience of the subscription business. That&#8217;s the ones that they&#8217;ve seen really grow, is they really nurture those people.

I&#8217;m Robbie Adair from OS Training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />And I&#8217;m Robert Jacobi from Botguard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie and Robert:<br />And we&#8217;re here to camp you up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />We&#8217;re thrilled to have Ronnie Burt from Gravatar at the Automattic Sound Stage at WordCamp Europe 2024 Torino. Welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Hey, thanks for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />So you&#8217;re supposed to tell us all about some of the cool stuff that Gravatar is doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Gravatar is 20 years old. It&#8217;s been in WordPress core for a long time, and we are reviving it and making it a profile-as-a-service. For the developers out there, use our APIs to have a much easier way of setting up whatever you need with anything profile-related: avatars, social connections, all that kind of thing. This is another way of building the open web and helping people connect, breaking down those barriers for everyone. We have free profiles and free Linkin Bio pages. You set them up, fill out your details, and that can be another place for you to point people to on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Ronnie, on the spot now. This can&#8217;t just be show and tell. What about single sign-on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yes, single sign-on is something we&#8217;re still working on. We want to get it right because when you&#8217;re dealing with something like single sign-on, security is super important. We&#8217;re continuing to test, but our goal is to have another option out there that is passwordless and supports passkeys out of the box for the WordPress ecosystem and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Cool. And you have some nice little toys here that you guys are giving out. Tell us about those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yeah, these are a lot of fun. They&#8217;re NFC tags, little round tags that you can put on your lanyard or, as I have, in my backpack. You tap them on your phone, and your Gravatar profile pops up. So instead of a business card, it opens up a browser window. Now I have everyone&#8217;s profiles that I&#8217;ve scanned as a tab in my browser on my phone today, and you can easily contact someone or follow them on X or whatever you&#8217;re following people on these days. It&#8217;s just better than the old paper business cards that we often throw away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Cool. I use LinkedIn quite often that way, but not everyone is on LinkedIn. So then they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh no, I&#8217;m not on that,&#8221; and you have to figure out something else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yeah, they&#8217;re not on it, or they&#8217;re not logged in at that moment. So when they click the link, it&#8217;s not there. They can&#8217;t even follow you because it opens up in the browser, and they have the app on their phone or whatever. Ours just opens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />There&#8217;s got to be some other cool stuff you could do with this. Maybe like a giant WordCamp at the end of the year where this simple, inexpensive tech could be deployed on everyone&#8217;s badge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yeah, badges would be great. We&#8217;d love for everyone to be happy to curate their profile. If you don&#8217;t want your real name on it, contact information, or an avatar photo, that&#8217;s great. That&#8217;s important information for others to know. You want to be anonymous or whatever it is. But when we&#8217;re trying to connect and grow a community or follow each other, this is a much easier way of doing it once. Wherever you go, whatever kind of conference or event, you don&#8217;t have to fill out another profile. It&#8217;s reusable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />So it&#8217;s not WordPress-specific?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />No, not at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />You keep talking about open. What does that actually mean? I can&#8217;t set up a Gravatar server?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Well, not at the moment. We&#8217;ve talked a lot about decentralization. We have a schema of data and how it&#8217;s stored, curated from different sources of standards for storing profile data. We&#8217;re hoping to use things like webfinger and other standards so that if someone wanted to host the data elsewhere, locally, or on their own site, they could do that. We could be the connection, like a switchboard, to have that data accessible via the API if you wanted it to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Boy, I&#8217;m just hogging the mic here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />You are. It&#8217;s okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Except for Ronnie. I&#8217;m hogging. Can I just type in gravatar.com/myhandle?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yep. That works. You can also, hopefully any day now, have any domain you want point to your Gravatar profile. You can get the domain through WordPress.com, and it&#8217;ll automatically connect to your profile. Eventually, we&#8217;ll open that up to existing domains and domains registered anywhere. It&#8217;s an interesting concept. Services like Blue Sky are using domains as usernames, but there&#8217;s no profile to point to for those domains. I hope more services integrate that so you don&#8217;t have to rush to get a username on every new service that pops up. You can use your domain as your username and another way of logging in, which can be another aspect of your digital identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Will you support third-level domains, like if I wanted contact.RobbieAdair.com to go to my Gravatar profile?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />I hope so. We&#8217;re still working on that. You can definitely do a redirect, but that&#8217;s not the same as it being the domain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Oh, note to self: redirect me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Yeah, you just can&#8217;t point an A record to it, I guess, is what you&#8217;re saying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />But that&#8217;s definitely on our list that our teams are working on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />What about company profiles versus individual profiles? Can I make an OSTraining profile like I do on LinkedIn or any other social media platform?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yeah, we have a lot of those. Every profile is just an email address, so you can set one up for whatever email address you want. It doesn&#8217;t need to be a person or your legal identity. It can be a persona, a company, or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />A bot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />It can be a bot. That&#8217;s an interesting use case for our API. In this era of bots, we have verification. When you connect your Meta account, WordPress.com account, Instagram account, or whatever to your Gravatar, we&#8217;re saying that the same person with this profile has all of these accounts. This helps verify that this profile belongs together, and there&#8217;s not really anything like that. People can use the API to figure out how human or how long this email address has been in use around the web, and how many places it&#8217;s being used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Is that already accessible?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yeah, all via our REST API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />That&#8217;s cool. Sorry, Robbie, before I forget, I have one huge wish. Are we going to be able to change our wp.org usernames?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />I don&#8217;t know anything about .org usernames.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Darn it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />What about the handy dandy chip? Do you also have QR codes it generates for us?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yes. When you log into your profile, there are QR codes you can download and use. I&#8217;ve seen this a few times at farmer&#8217;s markets, musicians, all these places where people have a Venmo QR code, an Instagram QR code, and a wall of QR codes. Instead, they could have their QR code to their Gravatar profile. At the top of the profile, they can list their Venmo, Instagram, etc. It&#8217;s a much easier user experience. I think that&#8217;s a great free use case for creators and small businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Awesome. You&#8217;ve mentioned a few things, but can you tell us the roadmap for the rest of this year and maybe next year?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Going back to OAuth and authentication, we&#8217;re still working on it. We have more domain stuff coming and will spend a lot of time on Linkin Bio Service. We were the original Linkin Bio service 20 years ago, but there were no Linkin Bios then. We&#8217;re figuring out what people would like to see on this page. We don&#8217;t want to turn it into a whole website, but you&#8217;ll see a lot of focus on making those more customizable and useful for different use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />That&#8217;s excellent. I&#8217;m excited. I don&#8217;t like using paper cards, so anything that makes my life easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Yeah, me neither. Update everything at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />I haven&#8217;t carried cards in so long, and I usually try to default to LinkedIn or something I think people will have. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve had to show people how to use LinkedIn that way. Sometimes you don&#8217;t want to send your full contact to someone else. This is nice because it gives them the option of whether they want to save this as a contact, correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Exactly. You can enable a contact form so you&#8217;re not sharing your personal data, but they can choose to send you a message. We limit the message to half a tweet or half an old tweet, so like a hundred characters or less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Half an old tweet, half a UX. 75 characters or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />It&#8217;s on purpose. We don&#8217;t want people to send you a bunch of spam and sales stuff. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;We just met at WCU, let&#8217;s follow up in two weeks.&#8221; You get all of their Gravatar contact information and profile data in the email, and you can choose to reply. It&#8217;s a nice handy way of making contacts in person a little smoother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />We&#8217;re going to need an app for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />You can&#8217;t see Ronnie&#8217;s face, but that was a wink, wink, nudge, nudge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Yeah. I love the little chip, but I don&#8217;t always want to have it with me. Could we have it in our wallet on our iPhone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ron</p>\n\n\n\n<p>nie:<br />Absolutely. That&#8217;s going to come a lot faster than the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />That works for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Yeah, works for me too. Great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Awesome. What&#8217;s the best way to get ahold of you? I hope it&#8217;s gravatar.com/ronnie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Yes, gravatar.com/ronnie, R-O-N-N-I-E, or Ronnie Link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Woohoo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />He&#8217;s already got his custom domain ready to go. I love it. Fancy. Well, thank you so much, Ronnie, for chatting with us. Kudos on it. I love it, and now I&#8217;m going to go get my chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ronnie:<br />Thank you very much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert:<br />Thank you, Robbie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbie:<br />Thanks, Robert. It&#8217;s fun. I will see you on the next episode of Do the Woo.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of<strong><em> All Things WordPress and WooCommerce</em></strong>, hosts <strong>Robbie Adair</strong> and <strong>Robert Jacobi</strong> have a great chat with <strong>Ronnie Burt from Automattic and Gravatar</strong>, during WordCamp Europe 2024 in Torino. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their conversation jumps into the exciting advancements and features that Gravatar is introducing as it celebrates its 20th anniversary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Highlights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar is being revived and expanded to offer profiles as a service. Developers can use Gravatar&#8217;s APIs to set up profiles, avatars, social connections, and other profile-related functionalities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar offers free profiles and Linkin Bio pages where users can fill out their details and use it as a point of contact on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar is working on implementing a secure, passwordless single sign-on feature that supports passkeys, enhancing the security and ease of user authentication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar provides NFC tags that users can attach to their lanyards or backpacks. When tapped on a phone, these tags open the user&#8217;s Gravatar profile, serving as a modern alternative to business cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can download QR codes from their Gravatar profile, making it easy to share contact information and social media links in a single, streamlined manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar will soon allow users to point any domain to their Gravatar profile, enhancing personal branding and simplifying digital identity management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can create profiles for companies, personas, or even bots, not just individuals. This flexibility allows for diverse use cases, including business and personal branding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar&#8217;s API can be used to verify the ownership and connectivity of multiple accounts (e.g., Meta, WordPress.com, Instagram) to a single profile, helping to establish a verified digital identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar profiles can include contact forms that allow users to send messages without sharing personal data. The messages are limited in length to prevent spam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upcoming features include enhanced OAuth and authentication, more domain functionalities, and customizable Linkin Bio pages. Gravatar aims to refine and expand these services based on user feedback and evolving needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://gravatar.com\">Gravatar.com</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/ronnie\">Ronnie&#8217;s Gravatar </a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Jun 2024 08:17:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:48:\"WpOrg\\Requests\\Utility\\CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 15:17:32 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Fri, 05 Jul 2024 15:00:52 GMT\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:2:\"br\";s:7:\"alt-svc\";s:19:\"h3=\":443\"; ma=86400\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211220193300\";}','off');
