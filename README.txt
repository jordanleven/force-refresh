Force Refresh is a simple plugin that allows you to force a page refresh for users currently visiting your site.


== Description ==
Force Refresh is the best plugin for requesting browsers to refresh their page. Perfect for single-page applications or pages that bring in feeds, this simple plugin will allow you to force a page refresh for users currently visiting any page of your site.

**Features**

- Support for both parent and child themes
- Allows an admin to simply click a button to request browsers to refresh their page. This is done within two minutes after making the request.

**Feature Requests and Bug Reports**

Please report any feature requests you have or bugs you encounter [under the Support tab](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/force-refresh). This is a new plugin and I'm hoping to add more user-requested features to make this useful to developers.

== Installation ==

Upload the Force Refresh plugin to your site, and then simply activate it. To force a refresh, just navigate to "Tools", click on "Force Refresh" and click the button that says, "Refresh Site."

== Screenshots ==
1. Under Tools, you can click "Refresh Site"
2. After clicking the button, you'll receive confirmation that you've requested connected browsers to refresh.
